add mru tab switching functionality fixes 5344 first thing did was give the `pane` class an `itemstack` property to keep track of the order the items were used the main function added is `activatenextrecentlyuseditem` which walks down the `itemstack` each time the user hits tab after ctrl is held down set up the keymap for ctrl tab but still don have the keymaps figured out for when ctrl is held down and tab is pressed over and over before lifting up on ctrl something else need to figure out is how to call specific function to move an item to the top of the stack once ctrl is lifted so based on the assumption that can make keymap for holding down ctrl and pressing tab over and over suggestions are welcome set up my code so that `activatenextrecentlyuseditem` would be called each time the user hits tab when holding down ctrl each call to this function would walk down the `itemstack` when the user lifted the ctrl key somehow we would need to call `stopmovingthroughstackandmoveitemtoendofstack` yeah we can rename this which would move the item the user stopped on to the top of the stack modified the serialization too so the `itemstack` would persist the scenarios was focusing on are nothing is wrong no `itemstack` serialized some items not serialized for some reason there is different number of items in the `itemstack` than in the `items` array wrote tests for the mru functionality and for the different serialization scenarios so yeah this won work correctly until can figure out the key maps for holding ctrl down and hitting tab more than once and until can figure out how to call `stopmovingthroughstackandmoveitemtoendofstack` when ctrl is lifted >>>work-in-progress

proposal api enhancement for editors with block decorations fiddled with the block decoration features to check how this would affect the minimap and as suspected it completely breaks the sync between the two views the biggest concern have for the moment is that there is no public api to get the height and the position of line with block decoration attached since guess these are quite costly operations that are already handled by the editor view would expect it to expose these informations publicly so that we don need to traverse all the editor layers and decorations to compute these values another approach would be to have two sets of scroll values one that account for the decorations and one that doesn for instance with block decoration of 100px height at one line the first method would return scroll height equal to the height of all lines 100 and the other one would return the just the height of all lines same goes for the scroll position the first one would returns the scroll as it used in the view the other one would return the scroll position ignoring the block decoration clamping the value to the start end of the line depending on whether the block is displayed before or after the line third possibility is to have scroll position defined as couple of value the first visible line index and position within the line in the range if we have access to the line position and height through an api we can compute the corresponding scroll top or map this to any other type of grid and still be in complete sync with the editor another concern for the minimap is that block decorations breaks the assumption that an editor lines all fit on predefined grid it means that can no longer use ratio to transpose line height and position and still get an integer value at the end let say line takes 17px in the editor and 3px in the minimap can always assume that line 11 will be at 30px in the minimap now with block decorations line can have an arbitrary height which means that if apply this ratio to get the line height ll probably end up with decimal value and as the minimap is using canvas decimal values need to be avoided at all cost to preserve the crispness of the minimap render to workaround that would probably need to map every line heights from the editor to rounded value more suited to the minimap but same thing here it would better if could avoid traversing all the editor lines to make this computations how do you feel about this cc nathansobo as cii >>>enhancement proposal

window fails to open on fedora 23 followed the instructions to install on fedora 23 and get no application window when launched from the command line or the desktop in the end it does imply the window is open and the atom process continues to run there simply no ui other than the menu bar drop down this is fedora 23 with gnome atom version fc21 same behavior on both x11 and wayland here is what ends up in syslog any ideas what going on let me know what other information might be helpful >>>bug linux more-information-needed

everything feels slower on retina screen hey recently switched from st to atom and noticed that it feels really slow to even write on retina screen think this issue is partly addressed in 1666 but feel that starting new conversation about performance on retina displays is necessary since it is unbearable right now used tool called retina display menu https roaringapps com app rdm retina display menu to quickly switch between normal retina displays and used dev tools to capture this information while pressed arrow down key few times to scroll 400 line js file non retina non retina http imgur com r8gdjcp png retina retina http imgur com sbtng1q png it seems quicker to complete on retina screen but the general experience was really bad due to low fps although it only shows information about few seconds it might give you an idea about how it lacks responsiveness on retina screen and this holds true even when writing code although not as extreme as scrolling btw experience on retina screen with `atom safe` seems much better compared to retina in normal non safe mode but do not think it is related to any package since it is still not as good as `atom safe` with non retina so any ideas about where to start to fix this >>>more-information-needed performance

extending texteditor functionality is not trivial trying to extend the functionality of the texteditor seems unnecessarily difficult doing the following results in an error error overriding default functionality becomes difficult and results in hacky solutions https github com adrianlee44 atom coffee compile commit c50d31a9c1e9ac8722e7692eb99e7dd4da66fc03 diff 8cf67b8cb46941d3297a4538472734a4r117 to overcome the issue these kind of solutions are probably very prone to breakage as atom updates and is therefore not ideal could we please have straightforward way of extending core components in the atom api >>>api feedback
apm test atom dev test displays wrong file names how to reproduce this bug open package or create new one run `apm test` if you created new package with package generator the specs will fail and display an error like `expected life to be easy spec testing package view spec coffee 20 rename `spec testing package view spec coffee` renamed it to `testing package view2 spec coffee` run `apm test` again the specs fail as expected but instead of showing the new file path it shows the old one assume this is caching issue because clearing atom compile cache` fixes the bug for me >>>bug

properly restore initialpaths so project paths are not loaded as files if project folders no longer exist or are not mounted then atom would open them as buffers which are empty because the corresponding file did not exist and if it did it would be directory which would make little sense this threads the right state through the startup sequence so that `initialpaths` which actually are project roots are restored correctly >>>atom needs-review

swap command control keys cmd ctrl swap command control keys for all atom shortcuts atom has different keyboard shortcut defaults based on platform on mac it uses `cmd` and on windows `ctrl` for many modifier combos the goal is to have the windows keyboard shortcut defaults on mac this could end up being able to choose which set of keyboard shortcuts to use or even alias control to command via hook as mentioned here https github com atom atom issues 2349 issuecomment 45924381 for now possibility is to write script to swap them all and put them in the `keymap cson` or copy of the platform specific configs https github com atom atom blob master keymaps win32 cson into `keymap cson` am using sharemouse http www keyboard and mouse sharing com synergy http synergy project org is another alternative so can seamlessly move from windows machine to mac with one set of keyboard mouse but this also means that often hit the wrong key combo the first time using `ctrl v` on mac etc for basic shortcuts such as copy paste or anything else listed in the top menu you can use this trick http superuser com 363355 130885 to alias it over but many of the atom commands are in the internals that can be mapped this way as an aside if someone knows how to map `ctrl` key events to `cmd` on mac this would be solution note swapping the functionality via system preferences keyboard keyboard tab modifier keys only applies to the keyboard hooked up to the mac itself and the physical keyboard in my setup is on the windows machine probably would work to have it the other way around though >>>feedback

saving files in safer way we have found that atom is overwriting file using `fs writefilesync in both `textbuffer saveas` and writing configuration file note that `fs writefilesync opens file with `o trunc` flag imagine that there is system crash in between all data may be gone leaving blank file in the file system our automated tool found this potential crash unsafety this is particularly important when there is no backup file even if no backup file means less guarantee the backup file treatment is correct the correct way to save file write contents to backup file rename the backup to the original file the key is that is ensured to be atomic by modern file system implementations like ext4 it is optional to add fdatasync between and in linux though am not quite sure of behaviors under windows here are some discussions fyi http stackoverflow com questions 1812115 how to safely write to file >>>duplicate

possible data loss when editing files on samba shares from os in atom few days ago opened 10558 temp files are created on samba shares that aren deleted on close can be deleted manually and are only deleted upon unmounting the share seeing similar behavior but with edited files as well not just temp files ve only seen this once but ve only performed editing sessions in atom in which edited files on samba share so those aren great odds as said in 10558 didn see this issue in edited lots and lots of files on samba shares in and had no problems at all little bit more about the setup os 10 10 running windows sp1 vm in vmware fusion some directories are shared from the windows vm using windows file sharing steps using finder in os mount samba share from the windows vm open atom open file on the samba share in atom edit the file save edit save etc close the file in atom open another file edit save edit save etc close atom at this point everything seemed good later attempted to edit the file opened in step from within the windows vm reading the file worked but it was locked for writing dismounted the samba share to see if that closed the handle it did close the handle it also entirely deleted the file had been editing now there are several moving parts in the above scenario atom os fusion windows vm can guarantee that atom is the part causing the data loss but haven seen files get locked like this and only unlocked and deleted when the share is unmounted as in 10558 which is specifically about temp files except in atom let me know if should merge this issue with 10558 merged that issue with this one see comments below edit 10598 samba shares and atom which was closed as dupe of this one notes the last problem is that changing words in samba share can damage files the word had to be changed is replaced with nothing not positive what that means but it reminds me that missed step above in the windows vm rename the file opened in step maybe it does mean what think it means which also would seem to match my experience if you edit file on samba share in atom and then rename the same file via the os that the samba share resides on then when the samba share is dismounted the file is deleted completely sometimes at least on os >>>needs-reproduction network

atom launch story is complicated and confusing how to launch atom in specific states is bit of magic that is only known to few some features are more obvious like dev mode and safe mode but even then the full effects of each of these modes are not fully documented anywhere and therefore they are often misunderstood even by people who use these modes often the purpose of this issue initially is to capture the list of initial states that people want to launch atom into eventually we will create plan and design for making each of them easy well understood and as obvious as possible to newcomers to atom if possible ll add links to other issues prs discuss topics and other sources to illustrate atom launch modes these are the modes that atom more or less supports or are implied by the modes that atom does support project whether with single or multiple roots no project mdash open specific files with no tree view restore last state project or no project restore specific project state dev mode mdash since this is designed as an aid for atom development it mostly only makes sense in combination with the project mode but perhaps overlooking something safe mode mdash can be combined with any of the above modes other than dev mode each of these should have an obvious and unambiguous way of launching them both from the command line and from the gui additional command line thoughts sometimes people want to modify the state of atom from the command line and sometimes they don some consideration should be given to these scenarios add file to an open session of atom add project root to an open session of atom launch atom in any mode when an open session of atom is running even when it may seem the user may want one of the two above but doesn for instance open file that exists in the project that is open in the current session of atom but want it in new atom session with no project mode state there are things that are serialized and stored when atom exits it is completely non obvious what items belong to this set and what items do not as well as how to restore the saved items when next launching atom decisions should be made about whether some of these items belong to the specific mode that atom is in or if they are more global state that people expect to be in place the next time atom is launched or even an individual file is opened post launch no matter what mode atom is launched in list of open tabs editor state mdash where the cursor is in the file etc unsaved changes to files untitled buffers per file indentation settings per file line ending settings per file encoding settings pane configuration https github com atom atom issues 10545 >>>proposal

fixed the indentation logic updated previously the logic lacked handling of multiple matches of the increase decrease regexs so things like the following javascript would not be handled correctly the last line would be indented fixed that also revisited the logic regarding decreaseindent and decreasenextindent it did not seem very logical that decreaseindent did not correspond to increaseindent decreaseindent regarded the current line whereas increaseindent regarded the next line just like decreasenextindent for that reason renamed decreaseindent to decreasethisindent and decreasenextindent to decreaseindent this way we also avoid whole lot of issues related to the concept of decreasenextindent because most of the language packages looked at have not yet adopted it but the semantics of decreaseindent had changed so now the semantics of decreaseindent is back to what it was and decreasethisindent is the new concept also now using the tokenized line to determine whether in decrease pattern appears within quoted string and ignoring it in that case rather than requiring regexes for checking whether or not the occurrence is within quoted string or not the examples saw for that were wrong too things like are non sense because things like var hey are perfectly fine one really needs to reason about balanced quotation to get it right and the tokenizer already does that for us so let use it rather than reinventing the wheel the decrease increase regexes can now be much simpler in the language packages in this version we use decreaseindentpattern as the default value for decreasethisindentpattern which is ok because that pattern is never applied matched more than once which was the previous behavior >>>atom needs-testing

double click drag selections have unusual and bad behavior on non word characters note this may not be bug in the sense that the behavior may be intended but many text editors apple text input boxes emacs have better behavior to reproduce enter the following text double click and hold on the word `multiple` this will select the word `multiple` and as expected enter per word selection drag move the mouse to the right and the word `words` will be correctly selected all at once however it is impossible to add the to the selection without the this is different behavior than you would see in some other text editors including emacs and mac os default input fields the reason this is bad is it is harder than other editors to select `multiple words without the close parenthesis this seems to come up lot when programming and is my biggest pet peeve with atom >>>needs-reproduction

fixed the indentation logic previously the logic lacked handling of multiple matches of the increase decrease regexs so things like the following javascript would not be handled correctly the last line would be indented fixed that also revisited the logic regarding decreaseindent and decreasenextindent it did not seem very logical that decreaseindent did not correspond to increaseindent decreaseindent regarded the current line whereas increaseindent regarded the next line just like decreasenextindent for that reason renamed decreaseindent to decreasethisindent and decreasenextindent to decreaseindent this way we also avoid whole lot of issues related to the concept of decreasenextindent because most of the language packages looked at have not yet adopted it but the semantics of decreaseindent had changed so now the semantics of decreaseindent is back to what it was and decreasethisindent is the new concept also now using the tokenized line to determine whether in decrease pattern appears within quoted string and ignoring it in that case rather than requiring regexes for checking whether or not the occurrence is within quoted string or not the examples saw for that were wrong too things like are non sense because things like var hey are perfectly fine one really needs to reason about balanced quotation to get it right and the tokenizer already does that for us so let use it rather than reinventing the wheel the decrease increase regexes can now be much simpler in the language packages >>>atom needs-review needs-testing

fix f11 keymaps function key keymaps don work when they feature upperface characters they still tend to work because they typically have an application menu item which is associated with it and falled back upon the main difference is that the originalevent keyboardevent is not retained when doing this fallback as atom thinks that the menu item was pressed instead of the keymap fixes 10287>>>needs-review
reloading atom with devtools open and breakpoints deactivated will hit breakpoints possibly an electron bug steps to reproduce open devtools add breakpoint somewhere in atom init logic press the deactivate breakpoints button reload atom via ctrl alt while devtools is open expected the breakpoint is ignored actual the breakpoint is hit notes breakpoints work again if they are activated and deactivated before resuming the debugger >>>bug

file opens in wrong window when having two atom windows open one with project and one without if you want to open file that belongs to the project opened in window and opens the file in window it will be opened in window instead reproduction steps open project folder refered to as window open another atom window refered to as window open file in window that belongs to the project folder opened in window expected behavior when opening file from window it is expected that the file will open in the window you try to open it in observed behavior when opening file from window the file was added to the view of window this happens both when drag and dropping and using the open file dialog from the explorer window can drag and drop from atom window to another when dragging from tab to tab atom version os and version window enterprise 64 bit installed packages atom pair 10 merge conflicts minimap 19 minimap git diff script sublime style column selection additional information problem can be reproduced in safe mode yes problem started happening recently didn happen in an older version of atom unknown problem can be reliably reproduced doesn happen randomly yes problem happens with all files and projects not only some files or projects yes>>>bug
package update release notes information hi would like to propose new feature regarding package update process currently when an package update is available atom does not show what exactly changed have plenty of packages installed and no one provides clear changelog that you can see in the available updates page it would be great to display the release notes of the packages when you click the package name in the available updates page guess we need to introduce to the community an official way to do it thanks >>>duplicate wrong-repo

look into vs code editor implementation improve editor performance hi have been following the latest versions of atom and vs code looking for st replacement ideologically would prefer atom because it is more open source and seems much more flexible compared to vs code however performance especially ux performance has always been the major factor stopping me from switching from st am guessing that am not alone in this and at the moment it seems like vs code has the edge in that respect its editor has better performance compared to atom for example when test the find command in this file https github com yemsalat spark lang blob master src parser parser js and search for things like peg this etc clean install of atom takes between 1s 5s while vs code does it almost instantly would say no more then 250ms it is also much better at live updating the search results as you are typing am testing this on year old i5 8gb laptop think looking into their implementation could be helpful as in my opinion improving editor performance can highly increase the editor adoption rates among developers who have not made the switch yet ps the vs code editor can be found here https github com microsoft vscode tree master src vs editor >>>atom feedback performance

optimize launch performance by ordering asar contents for the last couple days ve been investigating reports that n1 mail client based on the atom source launches really slowly on machines with traditional spinning drives the asar archive format improves launch performance by reducing the number of file descriptors the app needs to open but is still sub optimal for users without ssds files required to open and initialize the first window are scattered everywhere within the archive and reads span the entire 80mb asar file this is bad for number of reasons modern hard drives take 12msec to seek to new read locations ssds take 16ms in worst case scenario where each file is in separate cold disk block within the asar file electron can only read 125 files second hard drives read in blocks of either 512 bytes or 4kb advanced format adopted in 2011 and many of the files in the asar archive are smaller than 4kb reading from random locations where adjacent files are not needed causes data to be loaded into cache which is not used here graph of reads within `app asar` when n1 launches expect this very closely mirrors atom read pattern at launch the vertical axis is byte offset within the asar and the horizontal axis is the order in which the file was read image https cloud githubusercontent com assets 1037212 11964126 ac0e04a4 a8a8 11e5 982f 507979441352 png patched electron to log asar reads and their offsets to file pr https github com atom electron pull 3902 and patched the asar library to accept this file as an ordering hint during the archive process pr https github com atom asar pull 52 this hint file allows the archive to be laid out optimally resulting in the following read pattern at launch image https cloud githubusercontent com assets 1037212 11964300 e53c9262 a8a9 11e5 9e42 cbf5938afccf png this ordering change improves launch performance considerably only have access to solid state drives but conducted tests with an old usb thumb drive it doesn suffer from slow seek times but does have low throughput rate and above applies for each test reset mac os filesystem cache `sudo purge` launched the app and measured time to inbox standard metric we use internally launching n1 from the thumbdrive is faster using the optimized asar ordering and expect gains could be greater on actual hdds there are bunch of other improvements that could be made breaking `app asar` into two archives and loading one completely into memory at launch could eliminate seeking at the cost of ram memory mapping the asar file might also improve performance since it can enable other operating system optimizations that said these are optimizations that only impact hdd performance and may not be worth building or maintaining order hinting is easy to implement and maintain and think it be good to add to the atom build process >>>atom performance

make it easier to quickly close large number of tabs have you ever noticed how you can close large number of tabs very quickly in chrome this is because the width of the tab is held constant until the mouse leaves the tab area so if close tab the next tab moves to occupy the exact same space that the previous tab did with the in the same position allowing me to quickly close large number of tabs by simply clicking repeatedly in the same spot ve noticed while using atom that oftentimes want to quickly close large number of tabs which proves to be challenging given the current state of tab closing below are two options for how this could be improved option easier move the to the same side tabs are floated for me tabs are floated left this may be different for right to left languages don know for me if the was also on the left then you could rapidly close tabs by clicking repeatedly in the same position since the of the next tab would occupy the same position as the of the tab that was just closed this seems like the obvious solution to me but there may be other reasons that the was placed on the right hand side that not aware of option more difficult leave the where it is on the right hand side but use chrome approach of keeping the tab size constant until the user moves the mouse out of the tab region this would require lot more code but would allow you to keep the on the right hand side if that is important for some reason >>>duplicate wrong-repo

save config cson in alphabetic order currently the `config cson` is being written in semi random order insertion order of the object properties that makes it pretty difficult so visually find certain options or compare two `config cson` files from different atom installations especially after changing configuration options back and forth the same set of config values results in very different file by ordering the object properties alphabetically the output of that file becomes deterministic the same configuration results in the same file and diffing or comparing changes becomes much easier the first commit only contains the new spec which obviously fails without any other changes the second commit updates the save function to store the data with deterministic order >>>requires-changes under-review

proposal behavior services class of issue that keeps coming up is the feature that has too many possible implementations designing coding and supporting all the possible implementations that the community asserts should be the default is too daunting task some examples of issues like this are behavior when closing the last open file or last open window 863 7835 https github com atom atom pull 2411 issuecomment 44497175 7726 behavior when opening files via drag and drop from the command line whether inside or outside of the project folder whether there is project or not etc sorting behavior in the tree view undo redo behavior fuzzy matching https github com atom atom issues 10266 additionally adding configuration options for all the possible permutations of these behaviors is hard to design and difficult for users to understand because of these challenges wanted to design system that keeps the base installation of atom simpler and more approachable for new users allows for maximum configurability in keeping with the hackable to the core philosophy of atom removes the necessity of the atom core team supporting all possible options how it works when feature described as foo in this example is identified for this approach behavior service should be designed and built into atom core as `atom foo behavior` the current behavior should be used as fallback in the case that no service provides an alternative see the `atom file icons` service in the tree view package https github com atom tree view as an example by convention packages that implement alternatives will end with `foo behavior` like `my awesome foo behavior` any interested party implements package that provides the service to customize atom behavior benefits with this system in use anyone can easily come along and implement their own behavior for this particular feature without needing to describe the behavior in detail the best specification is code after all needing to convince anyone that this is good idea or deserves to be in core this also allows for atom to act in manner that is perhaps more familiar and comfortable to the user but goes against the conventions of the platform that they are running atom upon challenges there are some pitfalls ve identified with this approach don think that they are significant enough to prevent going ahead with this but they should be kept in mind and solutions should be identified and implemented over time how granular should behavior services be in the example of the closing the last open file or last window mentioned in the introduction there are actually few tightly related behaviors does closing the last tab close the window does closing the last window exit the application does closing the last tab in pane destroy the pane does using the standard close command close the window if there is no file open should this be one service or four or somewhere in between because of the way the service hub system works there can be only one loaded and activated provider discoverability let say have installed package that overrides the tab pane window close behavior how do we indicate to the user that to configure this behavior they no longer use the built in configuration options but have to go to the `super special close behavior` package settings to configure it supportability when someone has an issue with how atom is behaving how can we easily find out that they have the `super broken close behavior` package installed and enabled cc atom feedback >>>api proposal
proposal block decorations the aim of this document is to write down some of the ideas nathansobo and discussed over the past days don think we should implement everything herein proposed in one single big step still feel like it valuable to have place to discuss the api and to share these ideas with the globe with meridians as of today atom doesn provide way to create decorations that affect screen rows layout more specifically we think it would be cool to expose an api that allows users to create something like the following block decorations https cloud githubusercontent com assets 482957 11395769 301ee8cc 936d 11e5 9323 1b376d39f1e9 jpg you can notice how lines of text break when block decoration begins and how they resume later when the decoration ends this hypothethical abstraction would cover several scenarios for package authors among which show diffs show previews and more generally provide richer experience within the editor this primitive would cover only decorations in between screen rows that is users won be able to insert inline elements between `s inside screen row by using block decoration api the code for using this api could look like the following am also thinking to provide shorthand for the above code but guess like to see how this gets used before dealing with this kind of extra details although prefer the latter version more in terms of readability book also feel like we might take this bit further by enforcing better separation of concerns between the model and the view by avoiding to pass an element as the `item` when decorating the marker and using the `viewregistry` instead this seems to stray from how we implemented other decoration apis so take this thought with grain of salt performance we would need to know the whole content height in advance in order to show the appropriate vertical scrollbar right now we measure dummy line height and calculate `dummylineheight model getscreenlinecount if we introduced this kind of custom content however we need to measure block decorations upfront and then calculate height like `dummylineheight model getscreenlinecount measuredblockdecorationsheight` when having lots of these loading refreshing them could become problematic on the core side the scrollbar problem seems the only issue preventing block decorations to be fetched rendered and measured incrementally as we do for other decorations we might even argue that people are used to this sort of progressive content loading on the web thus making this non problem but heart to have some more feedback on this for example what about minimap would think that it will need to know block decorations height in advance rather than as the user scrolls another optimization tactic we could employ is to split up the measurement tasks in chunks to be executed across multiple animation frames to tell the truth believe we should just go for the measure everything upfront approach first see how that feels and then re iterate on that later if needed racehorse styling because of shadow dom we will have to insert elements outside the shadow root and find way to teleport them in the right spot inside the editor content the most straightforward way of doing this could be the following ux when block decoration above the current scroll area changes its height we need to make sure to adjust the current scroll position seamlessly so that the editor doesn scroll down when the user is for example editing something question what about the gutter should we have block decorations in there as well naming should we consider other names for this api block decoration seems pretty sensible choice to me as it seems to reflect css semantics for elements with `display block` style what do you think bulb feedback is super welcome sparkles bow cc nathansobo maxbrunsfeld atom feedback >>>api proposal

atom startup perf question why do see blank screen for multiple seconds clock10 when booting new atom session tldr most of the startup time is spent requiring modules and deadlocked in node js

com assets 883126 11307738 e391b6e4 8f6e 11e5 8b13 5c4f6a0a1b8f png looking at the initial chunk before load is called it looks like we are being bogged down in simply requiring all of the modules

paint happen at this point we have pretty good picture of where the time is being spent on startup in the most ideal of situations where user does not have pile of plugins or custom themes to further slow it down screen shot 2015 11 20 at 13 53 am https cloud githubusercontent com assets 883126 11307762 07e07d14 8f6f 11e5 8f61 6b7f8a5eb306 png looking into the work that is happening inside of setup window prior to painting we can break the 200 ms down into specific segments of work that perhaps could happen after the initial paint thus prioritizing when we draw the ui to the user before loading additional modules and doing work that is blocking screen shot 2015 11 20 at 33 18 am https cloud githubusercontent com assets 883126 11307766 12c780b0 8f6f 11e5 91e5 07498a5b3563 png so with all of this information it is clear that we are paying significant cost due to the number of modules that are being required and time being spent inside of the require load dance prior to even trying to run any js one fun downfall of putting all of the requires at the top of all of your js files the profile deep dive does raise the question of how much of this require work can be pushed off to happen async after the initial paint would it be possible to precompile all of the js used in atom into single blob to avoid the fixed require cost how much of progressive experience is acceptable for plugins can we load them in after the fact or will this be too strange overall this profile shows that there is nothing that atom is doing wrong there are just some interesting performance costs that most developers we never run into or care about given that the difference between 200ms and 500ms startup is not something to spend time reworking the world around however for text editor where users are constantly opening new windows it can become quite noticeable and annoying welp hopefully this is helpful sparkles thanks again to paulirish and all of the awesome folks at github and atom

add linux archive to distribute atom now that atom has relocable portable config directories and different channels it makes sense to have way to distribute an archive on linux as suggested on bug 7102 containing latest available code for each channels this has two advantages this will enable in later step to enable auto upgrade to follow multiple channels optionally in parallel in different directories we can even think giving way for people to switch between channels as needed given the user config stay backward compatible happy to work on those problematics after if this pr is merged at some point if all dependencies are installed in the distribution the atom installation is then just question of extracting an archive requiring non root permission contrary to the deb or rpm packages we can then integrate this archive to be downloaded to some tools like ubuntu make https github com ubuntu ubuntu make issues we generate tar gz compressed archive we could switch to more performant tar xz but the first format is more widespread and usual did add the `mktar` to the `ci task` saw the rpm wasn in there so guess it only running on an ubuntu machine and tested it did add the task as well to `upload assets` but of course couldn test it the changes there are though minimal but can modify what necessary as needed as version contains upstream version channel name didn change anything in the naming of the archive publication and the folder in archive contains thus an uniquely defined build of course the resulting archive is linked against the libraries available in the builder version mktar is run where the deb is built which is guess the latest ubuntu lts tried the built archive on 14 04 lts 15 04 15 10 and xenial dev version and everything is working as expected if this doesn work on other distros which looking at the deps seems unlikely and we already only have one deb for debian ubuntu and one rpm for fedora opensuse we can build multiple archives but propose we starts with this one happy to do any changes that you feel are necessary >>>needs-review

request for markdown scroll sync in core this is formal request for functioning markdown scroll sync to be included in the atom core the lack of scroll sync and decent markdown editing like you have macdown for example is real killer for me being able to tolerate atom and sure not alone this is especially concerning considering that github itself has made such push to have markdown become standard and is quite incredible that it has had to fall to members of the community such as mark hahn with markdown scroll sync to implement features such as this themselves instead of being created by the core dev team the existing package is no longer supported by the original author and it doesn appear anyone has stepped up to try and improve on the current state of things furthermore this package at least in my experience tried on multiple machines and over many version of atom works tentatively at best with jerky and at times inaccurate sync and at the worst just doesn work at all or repeatedly crashes any input on this suggestion would be welcome because want to get the ball rolling again on making atom great editor for markdown any input on this suggestion would be welcome because want to get the ball rolling again on making atom great editor >>>duplicate wrong-repo

fr meta split ui and core the idea is very simple but doing it would probably cost lot what this feature request is is proposal for splitting the ui from the core part of the editor in such way that the ui and the core would communicate via an abstracted communication channel be it some sort of signals events when on local machine be it via network when on remote machine etc let me define the terms that using ui the visual part that we use too interact with atom panes tabs editor tree view etc core the thing that does file management open close save files holds unsaved buffers performs searching in the fs etc in other words the ui would be the `v` and the `c` and the core would be the `m` if had to describe that thing with `mvc` example such split would allow atom to edit files remotely like vim emacs over ssh connect to another atom core and interact with it collaborative editing between people speed up atom tricky first launch won have any speed boost but multiple instances won need to do the entire startup process but only search for an already available core and bind to it make atom ui bullet proof an ui crash which is still thing won close opened files nor lose unsaved buffers as those would be living in the core instead of the ui probably more >>>feedback
add section on reporting bugs to contributing guide this adds section on reporting bugs to the contributing guide and removes the generic section on submitting issues my plan is to add section on submitting feature requests and sections on other types of issues and pull requests so that we cover all the different types of contributions think that will be more helpful than single generic section since it will allow us to provide specific advice for each type of contribution and also think users will find the right section easier the section on submitting bug reports is structured in three parts what you should do before submitting bug report which information you should provide in bug report and template for structuring the information for the part on which information should be provided tried to structure this as list and bold key sections off each note so that it easy to scan think it will be helpful to list all the questions we often ask when debugging issues sometimes that will help users figure out things on their own and provide more helpful reports and it will allow maintainers to link to this section and say please provide more information as listed here atom feedback atom issue triage as always appreciate your feedback honey pot is there any other information we normally ask from users when debugging issues how do you like the idea of providing template here and should some other questions information be part of it >>>needs-review

startup snapshot this is an experimental branch which makes use of the v8 snapshot feature http www hashseed net 2015 03 improving v8s performance using html to preload some of the files atom requires on startup warning please note that this is far from being finished and could potentially never be aim to constantly update this pr description with what find out along with the performance savings that snapshotting brings us but we could experience some limitation that will force us to ditch this technique warning why snapshotting if we look closely at the startup profile we will soon notice that most of the time is spent in requiring files this is somewhat downside of using an interpreted language everything from loading files into memory to executing them must happen at runtime with snapshotting however we re allowed to take snapshot of the heap and make it available to the v8 context without actually running any code at runtime indeed we can exploit this to load files during our build pipeline `script build` and simply refer to the already required modules when atom is executed we think this could bring decent speedup in our startup phase which on my machine currently takes `1 0s` `1 2s` how does snapshotting works electron provides `mksnapshot` utility that allows to take javascript file and turn it into blob ready to be loaded in memory after generating it loading it is just matter of copying it inside the electron framework directory the capabilities that the snapshot phase provides though are somewhat limited unfortunately we won have access to many of the handy facilities that we re allowed to use in normal electron application for example node functions such as `object tostring` or anything else defined in v8 `js natives` native modules this means we have to change many here should say most of our files to be arranged in order to overcome the above limitations by deferring `require`s of native modules what currently in this pr have managed to load the entire `text buffer` library and to use it within atom plan to go on with other expensive require paths such as `src project` and `src config` am still bit unsure on how to proceed exactly but before automating the generation of `snapshot js` prefer to carefully include source files so that can patch external libraries without actually opening prs on the other repos this is because like to understand what are the realistic savings that this technique could allow us before delving into all the other details that concern building etc what missing here ll include what this pr would need in order to be ship ped do not expect to follow any of this point in particular order but they will serve as good todo list also in case anyone wants to help out with this generate `snapshot js` automatically right now have manually included the source files change all the core source files so that they can be required in the snapshot change all the libraries source files so that they can be required in the snapshot include benchmarks to demonstrate the potential of snapshotting investigate how debugging changes when having functions already loaded in memory can we use source maps here somehow any kind of feedback here would be super appreciated thanks bow cc nathansobo maxbrunsfeld atom feedback >>>performance work-in-progress

add an option on atom text editor to make it read only currently in nuclide we create subclass of `texteditor` named `readonlytexteditor` to try to make read only version https github com facebook nuclide blob 1fdf2b98 pkg nuclide ui atom text editor lib readonlytexteditor js this is pretty hacky and tough to maintain because it hard to be sure that we have blocked off all reasonable entry points that could mutate things currently on master the new refactoring of `texteditor` that frowns on using the constructor directly and strongly pushes for the use of `atom workspace buildtexteditor breaks our existing use of `extends texteditor` in implementing `readonlytexteditor` we can work around this using new hack will link once the diff is up but it would be nice to have proper support for this in atom we use `texteditor` in number of places as ui element to show things like console logs ll try to put up my own fix for this when get chance but filing this to have placeholder for now cc nathansobo maxbrunsfeld >>>enhancement

possible memory leak cut paste operations as suggested in issue 1827 opening new issue ve had to do alot of refactoring recently which has required lot of cut and paste ve had to restart atom more frequently leading me to ask why now when run heap dump the events object seems to just grow and grow suggesting leak haven been able to test extensively but quick inspection of the events object suggests the text snippet is stored in memory but never seems to be released would expect cut operation to copy the snippet but when cut another snippet of text would expect the content of the original cut to be released from memory my tests have been pretty unscientific but suggestive am cutting pasting an average of 40 50 lines of code at time when cut several larger snippets in reasonably quick succession say 400 lines of code memory consumption appears to increase more rapidly and remain high ve disabled every 3rd party plugin and several core plugins copy paste appears to work decently so ve been able to work around things by copying code and deleting it then pasting it it an annoying way to work though refactor though ve also noticed the atom helper typically reaching 9gb according to the activity monitor but my overall ram consumption hits 31 gb of 32gb as soon as kill the process it drops to 20gb total consumption all of this was primarily experienced on osx mavericks el capitan with an i5 cpu and 32gb of ram ve also experienced these issues on my windows laptop i7 with 12gb ram with no change after upgrading to win 10 finally do fair amount of work with electron and do not see memory issues like this in many of my apps albeit my text editors are substantially less complex than atom bring this up only because this to me suggests an issue with the atom app not the underlying electron platform hope this helps in some way it reaching point for me personally where may have to abandon atom due to sheer lack of productivity with it really hope don have to do that >>>bug performance

proposal marker layers supplants 9137 find and replace currently scales poorly with the number of results based on test of searching for the `e` character in `jquery js` that took 2932ms the biggest bottlenecks as follows 670ms 20 creating and subscribing to individual decorations for each result 1752ms 60 creating markers of which 893ms inserting markers into current marker index 533ms propagating marker creation events 125ms translating character offsets to rows and columns based on discussion with maxbrunsfeld and as cii this is proposal for changes to core apis that attacks these bottlenecks directly marker layers `textbuffer prototype addmarkerlayer` creates and returns `markerlayer` object that represents set of markers creating markers this object has `markrange` method that takes 2d rows column range as normal but it also has `markcharacterindexrange` that will eliminate the need to translate character indices to points during our scan both marker creation methods return an integer id instead of an object which can be passed to `getmarker` to retrieve the actual marker object for direct manipulation working in terms of ids rather than objects saves us from allocating large quantities of what are essentially convenience objects until they are needed we could potentially avoid the need to ever allocate marker objects by manipulating individual markers via methods on `markerlayer` that take an id such as `updatemarkerrange id range or `destroymarker id however this may interact poorly with existing apis and would need to be carefully considered observing updates `markerlayer`s will also have an asynchronous batch oriented change subscription function called `onupdate` for more information on our need to transition asynchronous events in the model and the naming scheme that could facilitate this transition see 9207 subscribers to `onupdate` will be called once for any number of marker changes occurring in given tick of the event loop if needed we can emit an event object containing arrays of `created` `updated` and `destroyed` marker ids but since the view re queries the marker index anyway during render we may want to wait until we have use case do however have feeling that subscribers could be interested in this information decorating marker layers to avoid the overhead of creating and subscribing to thousands of decorations we can add `texteditor decoratemarkerlayer` that accepts marker layer along with decoration descriptor object that should apply to every range in that layer this will allow us to create and decorate the search results layer once and from then on just manipulate markers other methods markers created via `textbuffer` existing `markrange` method will be created in default marker layer which can be accessed via `textbuffer prototype getdefaultmarkerlayer` otherwise don think we need to provide accessors or observation methods for marker layers as they can be explicitly passed to functions that need them finally `markerlayer` will need the utility methods `clear` and `destroy` creating markers in the background finally if the overhead of inserting markers into the index is still too slow using the new 1d marker index and avoiding the overhead of synchronous events we re going to need to populate it in the background this would add two complementary methods to the `markerlayer` `serialize` and `deserialize` they would delegate through to our marker index object which we could construct directly in the `scandal` background process and then serialize to be populated into highlighted marker layer after the scan completed >>>api performance proposal
proposal model change observation should be batch oriented and asynchronous we ve gained lot of performance in atom by switching from processing events synchronously and one at time to processing events asynchronously and in batches asynchrony and batching in the view layer originally we mapped individual changes to the editor model directly to individual updates to the dom synchronously now when the text editor model changes we schedule an asynchronous batched update of the view on the next animation frame we write this view update as straightforward function of the underlying data model adding indexes to the model where necessary to ensure we can recompute the view efficiently an asynchronous approach means that model updates have very predictable performance for any given operation we update small chunk of essential state along with any indexes and both of these operations can be made log or better in the size of the essential state of the model importantly these update operations do not synchronously fire event handlers that interact with the dom eliminating the risk of subscriber unexpectedly adding to the cost of particular update operation code that responds to changes is decoupled from code that makes changes meaning that once we make our operations fast they will stay that way the cost of updating the view is also easier to reason about in batched model we can write computation that performs predictably regardless of how many times the model has been updated since the last animation frame redundant dom updates are avoided and we can reason about the state of the view holistically and declaratively rather than concerning ourselves with the interactions of lots of individual updates making all model events asynchronous so far we ve really only applied this approach to the view layer but it makes sense at the model layer as well currently we expose synchronous event hooks all over the system for example we emit events when individual text changes are made to the buffer when individual cursors move and for each individual change of the active pane these synchronous events make the cost of model changes open ended and encourage redundant computation in layers of derived state for example commenting out 1000 lines currently causes 1000 individual text changes each of which is processed through the tokenized buffer and display buffer as separate event and that not even accounting for the cost of third party event handlers the solution is to make event propagation at the model layer asynchronous and batch oriented in the same way we ve done at the view layer instead of events synchronously reporting on individual changes such as `marker prototype ondidupdate` and `marker prototype ondiddestroy` events should instead asynchronously describe groups of changes that have occurred within given frame of time such as hypothetical `markerlayer prototype onupdate` that emitted events with list of `created` `updated` and `destroyed` markers to achieve and maintain performance in atom we need to systematically replace all synchronous event subscription points in the system starting with the hottest code paths highest on my list are atom synchronous handling of individual marker events which degrades the scalability of find and replace along with our synchronous handling of buffer changes which causes bad performance in the face of large numbers of text changes scheduling model change events going asynchronous means we can deliver change events at any time so when should we do so updating the view is the ultimate goal of most model changes meaning that the frequency with which we emit change events should be bounded by 60 frames per second or roughly 16 milliseconds however since model level change events often themselves result in additional model changes emitting events at higher frequency will be necessary to allow chained model updates to quiesce before the end of the frame budget simply emitting events on `nexttick` may be sufficient transitioning to asynchronous model change events ton of code has been written against atom synchronous model change subscription methods so dropping them any time soon is pretty much out of the question new asynchronous apis will need to be added alongside them and after we transition bundled packages over we can deprecate the old synchronous versions good way to slot these methods in may be with shift in our naming previously we adopted the `ondid and `onwill nomenclature to distinguish events occurring before or after specific moment in time since asynchronous events always occur after it may make sense to just drop the did from the name adopting scheme like `textbuffer prototype onchange` or `textbuffer prototype onupdatemarkers` there will be inconsistency during the transition but eventually only few `onwill special methods that actually allow synchronous cancellation will remain alongside host of `on methods >>>api performance proposal

api proposal decoration layers note this document is currently aspirational and describes the hypothetical design of an api that is yet to be implemented cc as cii maxbrunsfeld overview decoration layers provide an alternative api to marker based decorations for situations in which creating markers is too expensive two examples are spell check and find and replace with decoration layers instead of creating marker for every single decoration in the buffer package authors can perform work incrementally to describe only the decorations for the currently visible portion of the buffer creating decoration layer decoration layers are created by calling the `adddecorationlayer` method with single function returning decorations when necessary the editor will call this function with `range` object representing the currently visible portion of the screen in buffer coordinates full range is used rather than row numbers because due to soft wrapping only portion of line in the buffer might be visible buffer coordinates are used rather than screen coordinates because they map more directly to most kinds of analyses required for decorations such as scanning for search matches or highlighting misspellings to ensure smooth visual experience the decoration layer function is synchronous we may want to discuss allowing decoration layers to return promises but this would lead to decorations flickering into view and is unacceptable for our initial use cases the return value of decoration layer function should be an array of decoration descriptor objects each descriptor can contain any of the parameters passed to `decoratemarker` to create marker based decorations such as `type` `class` etc in addition each descriptor object must contain `bufferrange` key describing the range to which the decoration applies returned ranges should all overlap with the `visiblebufferrange` passed to the function decoration layer methods the `decorationlayer` object returned by the call to `adddecorationlayer` has two methods `update` and `destroy` decoration layer functions will be called automatically when the contents of their editor changes when decorations change for other reasons you ll need to manually inform the editor that your layer needs to be re rendered by calling `update` this method is asynchronous meaning call to update only schedules view update for the next animation frame we can potentially return promise that resolves when the update is completed if it needed to remove the decoration layer call `destroy` on it implementation interpolation decoration layers need to be fast enough not to impose undue overhead when the visible range changes on the editor however performing full screen search on every keystroke is untenable the solution to this problem is interpolation when the buffer changes should debounce calls into user defined decoration functions so as to only perform them at the end of sequence of changes in the meantime we ll want to keep decorations in the correct logical location during edits by maintaining local marker index when changes occur to the buffer we ll apply them to the layer marker index synchronously but we won re query the user defined function for each change like to use this as chance to test drive our new marker index https github com atom marker index library changes will need to be converted to absolute coordinates in order to use it but it the cleanest and fastest implementation and like to migrate to using it in `textbuffer` if it works out in this use case we shouldn store decorations as markers on the `textbuffer` because there ton of overhead associated with creating mutable markers that unnecessary in this case interacting at low level directly with an index will have much lower overhead to avoid the need to row and column based points to absolute character offsets repeatedly we may want to change the buffer apis to include offset information we ll need to calculate this information in the buffer anyway to accomodate use of the new marker index another tool that might be useful to aggregate changes is patch data structure https github com nathansobo atom patch this allows sequence of potentially overlapping splice operations to be recorded into the patch and then be played back in coalesced form asynchronously including the offset information and just writing synchronously into the marker index is probably easier but it worth keeping in mind that an efficient change tracking data structure exists updates to the view model relationship currently we return visible decorations from the model to the view in an object that indexed by marker id think we should add new private method to the model that intended to be consumed by the view it should return an array of decoration descriptors each containing range so that the view layer no longer needs to interact with markers this will make it possible to unify our handling of marker and layer based decorations in the view in single code path the model will be in charge of querying the marker store and decoration layers and combining everything into single array of data to be consumed >>>api

for unicode atom doesnt have concept of canonical equivalence or compatibility the underlying error for this issue causes multiple bugs as outlined below canonical equivalence issue consider the following two canonically equivalent code sequences `n 0061 0301 `o 00e1 in the following snippet of text the first line uses `n` but not `o` and the second line uses `n` but not `o` asdfasdfasdf aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa asdfasdfasdf if one enables soft wrap and sizes the window appropriately theyll notice that the first line wraps before the second line wraps as shown in the following image it seems as though atom navely calculates `n` as two separate characters would expect atom to treat it as single character additionally if one resizes the window appropriately they can see that the second code point in `n` can be separated and wrapped independent of the first code point as shown in the following image obviously atom does not do this for `o` this lack of canonical equivalence can also be demonstrated via the search feature as shown in the following images neither `n` is considered match for `o` nor vice versa atom should either match all characters that have that code point in the code sequence or all characters whose entire code sequence is match in regard to the third following image do not currently have guess as to what could cause the depicted result in regard to fix for this bug note that the following code sequences though visually `q u` are in fact all considered canonically equivalent `q 0061 0301 0305 should render as `r 0061 0305 0301 should render as `s 0101 305 should render as `t 0227 0301 should render as `u 01e1 should render as note that `r` does not render correctly as shown in the following image upon initial research this seems to occur for all characters in which the subsequent code points in the corresponding code sequence are not in ascending order compatibility issue compatibility comes into play for characters that might have distinguishable appearances but have the same meaning compatible characters are not necessarily canonically equivalent but canonically equivalent characters are always compatible as understand consider the typographic ligature code sequence fb00 the string ff code sequence 00ff 00ff is compatible with the ligature however in this particular case care should be taken to not consider them compatible if the latter one is followed by combining character note that compatible sequences shouldnt always necessarily be treated the same way it depends on the situation similar issues this appears to be related to 1783 but based on my findings these appear to be separate bugs 1783 appears to be caused by inconsistent character widths in the font this issue differs in that code points are not being properly combined it appears that there are many duplicates of 1783 that are unrelated to this issue some of the duplicates even initially appear similar to this one at first glance this appears related to 1894 but do not believe that they are related in any way there seem to be many issues related to this but none touch on the underlying problem of this one unicode equivalence closing remarks partial solution would be to normalize the underlying representation of the text users might expect the code sequences to not be modified so that would introduce challenge in terms of memory or efficiency fix should only be effective for unicode codings at the time of this writing the only supported unicode encodings are utf utf 16 be and utf 16 le since this is silent semantic issue there are no error reports to include all of the screenshots and described behavior are from atom 15 on os yosemite 10 10 no changes to the ui switching themes directly modifying the theme etc seem to affect any of the aforementioned issues more information in regard to the unicode aspect can be found in chapter of the unicode standard version core specification http www unicode org versions unicode7 ch03 pdf additionally an overview can be found on the unicode equivalence article on wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki unicode equivalence >>>atom

opening larger txt file slows atom upon opening freeze for period of time hey was just opening larger text file with atom editor on windows and noticed the following reproducable behaviour upon display of file atom editor freezed and did not respond to any actions after period of time minutes was able to use the file the file had size of 248kb so we are not talking about huge file this should in my humble opinion work smooth also closing the file tab produced short lag without responding to actions regards stefan>>>more-information-needed

dom based measurements supersedes and closes 6083 supersedes and closes 7945 brief flashback over the past month we have evaluated several strategies to attack the problem among which iframe build the lines inside an element and measure from them pros measurements happen in separate context completely decoupled from the current dom some optimization can therefore be applied skinnier dom less stylesheet and so on cons building the lines twice has cost which is higher than the optimizations we tried out moreover we cannot alter the original dom structure as otherwise measurements could be wrong canvas have canvas element and use the `measuretext` function to provide all the metrics we need to position visual elements pros measurements happen in separate context and the overhead is minimal cons css typography is not fully supported ligatures contextual alternates get screwed up and the risk of reporting corrupted measurements is very high no measurements instead of positioning decorations cursors etc with absolute coordinates embed them inside each line and let the browser figure out all the metrics pros no need for measurements and more semantical html in addition this enriches the power of styling customizations the user has the possibility to style piece of text surrounded by decoration cons worse performance because the dom gets more complicated and nesting increases overlays need to be displayed on top of lines node which forces us to employ tricks to let them appear in front of everything the present in this pr we have implemented dom based measurements the idea here is to append the real lines to the dom measure from them and render everything else that needs measurements every time `texteditorelement pixelpositionforscreenposition` or `texteditorelement screenpositionforpixelposition` is called we trigger reflow bit like the dom does when you try to read from it when its information is stale in `texteditorpresenter` we update the dom with all lines we ll need to measure before computing any state in order to avoid multiple reflows caused by reading from line nodes more than once what missing autoscroll when reaching the right end of the editor implement `screenpositionforpixelposition` in `linesyardstick` fix remaining specs avoid using `nodeiterator` as it is slow cache text nodes and measure those instead evaluate if caching already computed positions yields some improvements remove measurement in `texteditorcomponent readafterupdatesync` ensure we have no significant regression performance wise investigate why hasklig behaves oddly fix bug where the cursor disappears when moving it left right arrow up autocomplete plus arrow up wrap guide feedback is super welcome and appreciated thanks bow cc nathansobo atom feedback for eyes >>>needs-review needs-testing

remove jquery from atom core this has been long time coming made the early mistake of basing atom initial view system spacepen on jquery which solves lot of problems that aren at all relevant when targeting single modern browser engine last summer we removed the reliance on jquery from atom public api and setup pretty complicated layer of shims to keep the old jquery based views working through the deprecation period with that finally behind us this pr will remove jquery and spacepen entirely we ll need to transition bundled packages away from spacepen to finally get the benefit of reduced require time by not loading jquery but this is first step some things to note our default tooltips are based on bootstrap which ships its tooltip support as jquery plugin reworked their code to remove the dependency on jquery which could slightly alter couple corners of the api it would be great if people could help me test that the new tooltips work correctly in all cases some of our rarely used global spec helpers have been removed the last incomplete step is to switch our test reporter from spacepen to raw dom apis do worry that old packages that depend on jquery might break in unforeseen ways since we were augmenting the jquery that shipped with spacepen with extra stuff for example we had shimmed `trigger` to run atom commands but that no longer works not totally sure what going to happen but most packages developed in newer styles should have nothing to do with this >>>work-in-progress

project find and replace improvements although really glad switched from netbeans to atom and love many things about it do miss some features in the project wide find replace functionality so will try to list them here think the results screen shouldn be normal tab because sometimes it harder to find it when many taps are open think it better to have results as panel instead of normal tab should be able to have multiple search replace instances without having to reuse the same instance sometimes you want to search for multiple keywords and currently only able to have one search instance at time when replacing it very important to be able to select or filter out some results it really sucks when want to replace 99 results from 100 and cancel the whole thing just for one result want to skip that my basic thoughts and after discussing we can find more specific features and can then split them into different features or tickets now really have to go back to work >>>wrong-repo

gutter line number width minimum two characters this is suggestion the space for line numbers in the gutter should be at least two characters wide so that the transition from lines to 10 doesn change the gutter width the reasoning goes like this this transition happens when we ve just started writing new file it is quite likely few files are below lines and can be distracting unexpected movement in peripheral vision was torn out of concentration by this sudden movement once too many times so now have this in my `styles less` but that feels sub optimal even better but much harder to implement would be width that smoothly increases it could be set to log10 lines ch again minimum 2ch so that gutter width never jumps during normal editing >>>enhancement

copy paste doesn work properly with unix style line endings under windows copying ctrl ctrl from file with unix style line ending lf doesn work as expected since line endings are preserved on the clipboard this causes wide range of issues you can paste text in an application that doesn handle lf notepad for example but if you re using vim over putty that also doesn work even if the other app handles lf you have to be consistent so you can paste text from an crlf file into lf one or vice versa this issue is briefly discussed in 2822 and it is the reason of 5808 all other editors convert line endings in text placed on the clipboard sublime text jedit etc so in this regard atom behaves rather strangely compared to other editors the proposed solution in 2822 configurable line endings is insufficient since it based on the assumption that all files edited by the user are using the same line ending for example if ve got file with lf line endings and like to use copy paste then have to convert it to crlf and then copy the text want and then convert it back to lf to preserve the original format wouldn call editing lf files on windows rare use case especially among atom users atom should convert any text line ending to the platform native line ending before it is placed on the clipboard this conversion should only be done on the content that is placed on the clipboardthe text in the buffer should not be changed >>>bug
