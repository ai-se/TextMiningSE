add mru tab switching functionality fixes 5344 first thing did was give the `pane` class an `itemstack` property to keep track of the order the items were used the main function added is `activatenextrecentlyuseditem` which walks down the `itemstack` each time the user hits tab after ctrl is held down set up the keymap for ctrl tab but still don have the keymaps figured out for when ctrl is held down and tab is pressed over and over before lifting up on ctrl something else need to figure out is how to call specific function to move an item to the top of the stack once ctrl is lifted so based on the assumption that can make keymap for holding down ctrl and pressing tab over and over suggestions are welcome set up my code so that `activatenextrecentlyuseditem` would be called each time the user hits tab when holding down ctrl each call to this function would walk down the `itemstack` when the user lifted the ctrl key somehow we would need to call `stopmovingthroughstackandmoveitemtoendofstack` yeah we can rename this which would move the item the user stopped on to the top of the stack modified the serialization too so the `itemstack` would persist the scenarios was focusing on are nothing is wrong no `itemstack` serialized some items not serialized for some reason there is different number of items in the `itemstack` than in the `items` array wrote tests for the mru functionality and for the different serialization scenarios so yeah this won work correctly until can figure out the key maps for holding ctrl down and hitting tab more than once and until can figure out how to call `stopmovingthroughstackandmoveitemtoendofstack` when ctrl is lifted >>>work-in-progress

proposal api enhancement for editors with block decorations fiddled with the block decoration features to check how this would affect the minimap and as suspected it completely breaks the sync between the two views the biggest concern have for the moment is that there is no public api to get the height and the position of line with block decoration attached since guess these are quite costly operations that are already handled by the editor view would expect it to expose these informations publicly so that we don need to traverse all the editor layers and decorations to compute these values another approach would be to have two sets of scroll values one that account for the decorations and one that doesn for instance with block decoration of 100px height at one line the first method would return scroll height equal to the height of all lines 100 and the other one would return the just the height of all lines same goes for the scroll position the first one would returns the scroll as it used in the view the other one would return the scroll position ignoring the block decoration clamping the value to the start end of the line depending on whether the block is displayed before or after the line third possibility is to have scroll position defined as couple of value the first visible line index and position within the line in the range if we have access to the line position and height through an api we can compute the corresponding scroll top or map this to any other type of grid and still be in complete sync with the editor another concern for the minimap is that block decorations breaks the assumption that an editor lines all fit on predefined grid it means that can no longer use ratio to transpose line height and position and still get an integer value at the end let say line takes 17px in the editor and 3px in the minimap can always assume that line 11 will be at 30px in the minimap now with block decorations line can have an arbitrary height which means that if apply this ratio to get the line height ll probably end up with decimal value and as the minimap is using canvas decimal values need to be avoided at all cost to preserve the crispness of the minimap render to workaround that would probably need to map every line heights from the editor to rounded value more suited to the minimap but same thing here it would better if could avoid traversing all the editor lines to make this computations how do you feel about this cc nathansobo as cii >>>enhancement proposal

everything feels slower on retina screen hey recently switched from st to atom and noticed that it feels really slow to even write on retina screen think this issue is partly addressed in 1666 but feel that starting new conversation about performance on retina displays is necessary since it is unbearable right now used tool called retina display menu https roaringapps com app rdm retina display menu to quickly switch between normal retina displays and used dev tools to capture this information while pressed arrow down key few times to scroll 400 line js file non retina non retina http imgur com r8gdjcp png retina retina http imgur com sbtng1q png it seems quicker to complete on retina screen but the general experience was really bad due to low fps although it only shows information about few seconds it might give you an idea about how it lacks responsiveness on retina screen and this holds true even when writing code although not as extreme as scrolling btw experience on retina screen with `atom safe` seems much better compared to retina in normal non safe mode but do not think it is related to any package since it is still not as good as `atom safe` with non retina so any ideas about where to start to fix this >>>more-information-needed performance

properly restore initialpaths so project paths are not loaded as files if project folders no longer exist or are not mounted then atom would open them as buffers which are empty because the corresponding file did not exist and if it did it would be directory which would make little sense this threads the right state through the startup sequence so that `initialpaths` which actually are project roots are restored correctly >>>atom needs-review

swap command control keys cmd ctrl swap command control keys for all atom shortcuts atom has different keyboard shortcut defaults based on platform on mac it uses `cmd` and on windows `ctrl` for many modifier combos the goal is to have the windows keyboard shortcut defaults on mac this could end up being able to choose which set of keyboard shortcuts to use or even alias control to command via hook as mentioned here https github com atom atom issues 2349 issuecomment 45924381 for now possibility is to write script to swap them all and put them in the `keymap cson` or copy of the platform specific configs https github com atom atom blob master keymaps win32 cson into `keymap cson` am using sharemouse http www keyboard and mouse sharing com synergy http synergy project org is another alternative so can seamlessly move from windows machine to mac with one set of keyboard mouse but this also means that often hit the wrong key combo the first time using `ctrl v` on mac etc for basic shortcuts such as copy paste or anything else listed in the top menu you can use this trick http superuser com 363355 130885 to alias it over but many of the atom commands are in the internals that can be mapped this way as an aside if someone knows how to map `ctrl` key events to `cmd` on mac this would be solution note swapping the functionality via system preferences keyboard keyboard tab modifier keys only applies to the keyboard hooked up to the mac itself and the physical keyboard in my setup is on the windows machine probably would work to have it the other way around though >>>feedback

saving files in safer way we have found that atom is overwriting file using `fs writefilesync in both `textbuffer saveas` and writing configuration file note that `fs writefilesync opens file with `o trunc` flag imagine that there is system crash in between all data may be gone leaving blank file in the file system our automated tool found this potential crash unsafety this is particularly important when there is no backup file even if no backup file means less guarantee the backup file treatment is correct the correct way to save file write contents to backup file rename the backup to the original file the key is that is ensured to be atomic by modern file system implementations like ext4 it is optional to add fdatasync between and in linux though am not quite sure of behaviors under windows here are some discussions fyi http stackoverflow com questions 1812115 how to safely write to file >>>duplicate

possible data loss when editing files on samba shares from os in atom few days ago opened 10558 temp files are created on samba shares that aren deleted on close can be deleted manually and are only deleted upon unmounting the share seeing similar behavior but with edited files as well not just temp files ve only seen this once but ve only performed editing sessions in atom in which edited files on samba share so those aren great odds as said in 10558 didn see this issue in edited lots and lots of files on samba shares in and had no problems at all little bit more about the setup os 10 10 running windows sp1 vm in vmware fusion some directories are shared from the windows vm using windows file sharing steps using finder in os mount samba share from the windows vm open atom open file on the samba share in atom edit the file save edit save etc close the file in atom open another file edit save edit save etc close atom at this point everything seemed good later attempted to edit the file opened in step from within the windows vm reading the file worked but it was locked for writing dismounted the samba share to see if that closed the handle it did close the handle it also entirely deleted the file had been editing now there are several moving parts in the above scenario atom os fusion windows vm can guarantee that atom is the part causing the data loss but haven seen files get locked like this and only unlocked and deleted when the share is unmounted as in 10558 which is specifically about temp files except in atom let me know if should merge this issue with 10558 merged that issue with this one see comments below edit 10598 samba shares and atom which was closed as dupe of this one notes the last problem is that changing words in samba share can damage files the word had to be changed is replaced with nothing not positive what that means but it reminds me that missed step above in the windows vm rename the file opened in step maybe it does mean what think it means which also would seem to match my experience if you edit file on samba share in atom and then rename the same file via the os that the samba share resides on then when the samba share is dismounted the file is deleted completely sometimes at least on os >>>needs-reproduction network

atom launch story is complicated and confusing how to launch atom in specific states is bit of magic that is only known to few some features are more obvious like dev mode and safe mode but even then the full effects of each of these modes are not fully documented anywhere and therefore they are often misunderstood even by people who use these modes often the purpose of this issue initially is to capture the list of initial states that people want to launch atom into eventually we will create plan and design for making each of them easy well understood and as obvious as possible to newcomers to atom if possible ll add links to other issues prs discuss topics and other sources to illustrate atom launch modes these are the modes that atom more or less supports or are implied by the modes that atom does support project whether with single or multiple roots no project mdash open specific files with no tree view restore last state project or no project restore specific project state dev mode mdash since this is designed as an aid for atom development it mostly only makes sense in combination with the project mode but perhaps overlooking something safe mode mdash can be combined with any of the above modes other than dev mode each of these should have an obvious and unambiguous way of launching them both from the command line and from the gui additional command line thoughts sometimes people want to modify the state of atom from the command line and sometimes they don some consideration should be given to these scenarios add file to an open session of atom add project root to an open session of atom launch atom in any mode when an open session of atom is running even when it may seem the user may want one of the two above but doesn for instance open file that exists in the project that is open in the current session of atom but want it in new atom session with no project mode state there are things that are serialized and stored when atom exits it is completely non obvious what items belong to this set and what items do not as well as how to restore the saved items when next launching atom decisions should be made about whether some of these items belong to the specific mode that atom is in or if they are more global state that people expect to be in place the next time atom is launched or even an individual file is opened post launch no matter what mode atom is launched in list of open tabs editor state mdash where the cursor is in the file etc unsaved changes to files untitled buffers per file indentation settings per file line ending settings per file encoding settings pane configuration https github com atom atom issues 10545 >>>proposal

fixed the indentation logic updated previously the logic lacked handling of multiple matches of the increase decrease regexs so things like the following javascript would not be handled correctly the last line would be indented fixed that also revisited the logic regarding decreaseindent and decreasenextindent it did not seem very logical that decreaseindent did not correspond to increaseindent decreaseindent regarded the current line whereas increaseindent regarded the next line just like decreasenextindent for that reason renamed decreaseindent to decreasethisindent and decreasenextindent to decreaseindent this way we also avoid whole lot of issues related to the concept of decreasenextindent because most of the language packages looked at have not yet adopted it but the semantics of decreaseindent had changed so now the semantics of decreaseindent is back to what it was and decreasethisindent is the new concept also now using the tokenized line to determine whether in decrease pattern appears within quoted string and ignoring it in that case rather than requiring regexes for checking whether or not the occurrence is within quoted string or not the examples saw for that were wrong too things like are non sense because things like var hey are perfectly fine one really needs to reason about balanced quotation to get it right and the tokenizer already does that for us so let use it rather than reinventing the wheel the decrease increase regexes can now be much simpler in the language packages in this version we use decreaseindentpattern as the default value for decreasethisindentpattern which is ok because that pattern is never applied matched more than once which was the previous behavior >>>atom needs-testing

fixed the indentation logic previously the logic lacked handling of multiple matches of the increase decrease regexs so things like the following javascript would not be handled correctly the last line would be indented fixed that also revisited the logic regarding decreaseindent and decreasenextindent it did not seem very logical that decreaseindent did not correspond to increaseindent decreaseindent regarded the current line whereas increaseindent regarded the next line just like decreasenextindent for that reason renamed decreaseindent to decreasethisindent and decreasenextindent to decreaseindent this way we also avoid whole lot of issues related to the concept of decreasenextindent because most of the language packages looked at have not yet adopted it but the semantics of decreaseindent had changed so now the semantics of decreaseindent is back to what it was and decreasethisindent is the new concept also now using the tokenized line to determine whether in decrease pattern appears within quoted string and ignoring it in that case rather than requiring regexes for checking whether or not the occurrence is within quoted string or not the examples saw for that were wrong too things like are non sense because things like var hey are perfectly fine one really needs to reason about balanced quotation to get it right and the tokenizer already does that for us so let use it rather than reinventing the wheel the decrease increase regexes can now be much simpler in the language packages >>>atom needs-review needs-testing

only disable package if it isn already disabled fixes https github com atom atom issues 10358 wasn sure if this check was better suited for `package` or `packagemanager` but think it more within the scope of `packagemanager` to manage the state of the `core disabledpackages` keypath let me know if you think should move it though cc atom feedback >>>needs-review

fix f11 keymaps function key keymaps don work when they feature upperface characters they still tend to work because they typically have an application menu item which is associated with it and falled back upon the main difference is that the originalevent keyboardevent is not retained when doing this fallback as atom thinks that the menu item was pressed instead of the keymap fixes 10287>>>needs-review
reloading atom with devtools open and breakpoints deactivated will hit breakpoints possibly an electron bug steps to reproduce open devtools add breakpoint somewhere in atom init logic press the deactivate breakpoints button reload atom via ctrl alt while devtools is open expected the breakpoint is ignored actual the breakpoint is hit notes breakpoints work again if they are activated and deactivated before resuming the debugger >>>bug

file opens in wrong window when having two atom windows open one with project and one without if you want to open file that belongs to the project opened in window and opens the file in window it will be opened in window instead reproduction steps open project folder refered to as window open another atom window refered to as window open file in window that belongs to the project folder opened in window expected behavior when opening file from window it is expected that the file will open in the window you try to open it in observed behavior when opening file from window the file was added to the view of window this happens both when drag and dropping and using the open file dialog from the explorer window can drag and drop from atom window to another when dragging from tab to tab atom version os and version window enterprise 64 bit installed packages atom pair 10 merge conflicts minimap 19 minimap git diff script sublime style column selection additional information problem can be reproduced in safe mode yes problem started happening recently didn happen in an older version of atom unknown problem can be reliably reproduced doesn happen randomly yes problem happens with all files and projects not only some files or projects yes>>>bug
package update release notes information hi would like to propose new feature regarding package update process currently when an package update is available atom does not show what exactly changed have plenty of packages installed and no one provides clear changelog that you can see in the available updates page it would be great to display the release notes of the packages when you click the package name in the available updates page guess we need to introduce to the community an official way to do it thanks >>>duplicate wrong-repo

enhancement suggestion make non printing control character etc constants visible don know if this enhancement suggestion belongs in atom atom or in atom language ruby do suspect that this enhancement also applies to other languages such as python perl etc not exclusively to ruby given its display oriented nature it does seem to me to be atom core rather than syntax language ruby dependent see attached screenshots for comparison between what sublime text does and what atom does not yet do but should these two screenshots show exactly the same file lines of code in both atom and in sublime text the atom screenshot was taken in v1 but the same behavior exists in v1 my current atom in ruby also in other languages constant or variable can be declared as at line 31 in both screenshots for example constant esc an escape character code which has single character code integer value other instances of this sort of thing would include csi control sequence introducer si shift in so shift out char code values etc once declared sublime text will render graphic reverse video esc wherever that character code value occurs in subsequent character strings atom does not see lines 32 59 for the sublime text screenshot which clearly shows ansi escape sequence strings of characters including in comments the corresponding lines in the atom screenshot do not thus implying that these ansi escape sequence characters strings are malformed and missing the leading esc character suggestion request is to enhance atom or syntax language packages especially ruby to recognize such character code constants or variables and render them visibly as part of character strings where these occur mimicking sublime text in this regard my environment versions atom uname linux alikot 13 74 generic 118 ubuntu smp thu dec 17 22 52 10 utc 2015 x86 64 x86 64 x86 64 gnu linux sample screenshots atom and sublime text rubyconstants in atom v1 https cloud githubusercontent com assets 1362449 12023462 f1c5de60 ad56 11e5 8c99 181fed03082f png rubyconstants in sublimetext3 https cloud githubusercontent com assets 1362449 12023461 f1c35cd0 ad56 11e5 9cfc 38c17d3e0513 png thank you for your kind consideration and any guidance >>>enhancement

look into vs code editor implementation improve editor performance hi have been following the latest versions of atom and vs code looking for st replacement ideologically would prefer atom because it is more open source and seems much more flexible compared to vs code however performance especially ux performance has always been the major factor stopping me from switching from st am guessing that am not alone in this and at the moment it seems like vs code has the edge in that respect its editor has better performance compared to atom for example when test the find command in this file https github com yemsalat spark lang blob master src parser parser js and search for things like peg this etc clean install of atom takes between 1s 5s while vs code does it almost instantly would say no more then 250ms it is also much better at live updating the search results as you are typing am testing this on year old i5 8gb laptop think looking into their implementation could be helpful as in my opinion improving editor performance can highly increase the editor adoption rates among developers who have not made the switch yet ps the vs code editor can be found here https github com microsoft vscode tree master src vs editor >>>atom feedback performance

optimize launch performance by ordering asar contents for the last couple days ve been investigating reports that n1 mail client based on the atom source launches really slowly on machines with traditional spinning drives the asar archive format improves launch performance by reducing the number of file descriptors the app needs to open but is still sub optimal for users without ssds files required to open and initialize the first window are scattered everywhere within the archive and reads span the entire 80mb asar file this is bad for number of reasons modern hard drives take 12msec to seek to new read locations ssds take 16ms in worst case scenario where each file is in separate cold disk block within the asar file electron can only read 125 files second hard drives read in blocks of either 512 bytes or 4kb advanced format adopted in 2011 and many of the files in the asar archive are smaller than 4kb reading from random locations where adjacent files are not needed causes data to be loaded into cache which is not used here graph of reads within `app asar` when n1 launches expect this very closely mirrors atom read pattern at launch the vertical axis is byte offset within the asar and the horizontal axis is the order in which the file was read image https cloud githubusercontent com assets 1037212 11964126 ac0e04a4 a8a8 11e5 982f 507979441352 png patched electron to log asar reads and their offsets to file pr https github com atom electron pull 3902 and patched the asar library to accept this file as an ordering hint during the archive process pr https github com atom asar pull 52 this hint file allows the archive to be laid out optimally resulting in the following read pattern at launch image https cloud githubusercontent com assets 1037212 11964300 e53c9262 a8a9 11e5 9e42 cbf5938afccf png this ordering change improves launch performance considerably only have access to solid state drives but conducted tests with an old usb thumb drive it doesn suffer from slow seek times but does have low throughput rate and above applies for each test reset mac os filesystem cache `sudo purge` launched the app and measured time to inbox standard metric we use internally launching n1 from the thumbdrive is faster using the optimized asar ordering and expect gains could be greater on actual hdds there are bunch of other improvements that could be made breaking `app asar` into two archives and loading one completely into memory at launch could eliminate seeking at the cost of ram memory mapping the asar file might also improve performance since it can enable other operating system optimizations that said these are optimizations that only impact hdd performance and may not be worth building or maintaining order hinting is easy to implement and maintain and think it be good to add to the atom build process >>>atom performance

make it easier to quickly close large number of tabs have you ever noticed how you can close large number of tabs very quickly in chrome this is because the width of the tab is held constant until the mouse leaves the tab area so if close tab the next tab moves to occupy the exact same space that the previous tab did with the in the same position allowing me to quickly close large number of tabs by simply clicking repeatedly in the same spot ve noticed while using atom that oftentimes want to quickly close large number of tabs which proves to be challenging given the current state of tab closing below are two options for how this could be improved option easier move the to the same side tabs are floated for me tabs are floated left this may be different for right to left languages don know for me if the was also on the left then you could rapidly close tabs by clicking repeatedly in the same position since the of the next tab would occupy the same position as the of the tab that was just closed this seems like the obvious solution to me but there may be other reasons that the was placed on the right hand side that not aware of option more difficult leave the where it is on the right hand side but use chrome approach of keeping the tab size constant until the user moves the mouse out of the tab region this would require lot more code but would allow you to keep the on the right hand side if that is important for some reason >>>duplicate wrong-repo

proposal behavior services class of issue that keeps coming up is the feature that has too many possible implementations designing coding and supporting all the possible implementations that the community asserts should be the default is too daunting task some examples of issues like this are behavior when closing the last open file or last open window 863 7835 https github com atom atom pull 2411 issuecomment 44497175 7726 behavior when opening files via drag and drop from the command line whether inside or outside of the project folder whether there is project or not etc sorting behavior in the tree view undo redo behavior fuzzy matching https github com atom atom issues 10266 additionally adding configuration options for all the possible permutations of these behaviors is hard to design and difficult for users to understand because of these challenges wanted to design system that keeps the base installation of atom simpler and more approachable for new users allows for maximum configurability in keeping with the hackable to the core philosophy of atom removes the necessity of the atom core team supporting all possible options how it works when feature described as foo in this example is identified for this approach behavior service should be designed and built into atom core as `atom foo behavior` the current behavior should be used as fallback in the case that no service provides an alternative see the `atom file icons` service in the tree view package https github com atom tree view as an example by convention packages that implement alternatives will end with `foo behavior` like `my awesome foo behavior` any interested party implements package that provides the service to customize atom behavior benefits with this system in use anyone can easily come along and implement their own behavior for this particular feature without needing to describe the behavior in detail the best specification is code after all needing to convince anyone that this is good idea or deserves to be in core this also allows for atom to act in manner that is perhaps more familiar and comfortable to the user but goes against the conventions of the platform that they are running atom upon challenges there are some pitfalls ve identified with this approach don think that they are significant enough to prevent going ahead with this but they should be kept in mind and solutions should be identified and implemented over time how granular should behavior services be in the example of the closing the last open file or last window mentioned in the introduction there are actually few tightly related behaviors does closing the last tab close the window does closing the last window exit the application does closing the last tab in pane destroy the pane does using the standard close command close the window if there is no file open should this be one service or four or somewhere in between because of the way the service hub system works there can be only one loaded and activated provider discoverability let say have installed package that overrides the tab pane window close behavior how do we indicate to the user that to configure this behavior they no longer use the built in configuration options but have to go to the `super special close behavior` package settings to configure it supportability when someone has an issue with how atom is behaving how can we easily find out that they have the `super broken close behavior` package installed and enabled cc atom feedback >>>api proposal
proposal block decorations the aim of this document is to write down some of the ideas nathansobo and discussed over the past days don think we should implement everything herein proposed in one single big step still feel like it valuable to have place to discuss the api and to share these ideas with the globe with meridians as of today atom doesn provide way to create decorations that affect screen rows layout more specifically we think it would be cool to expose an api that allows users to create something like the following block decorations https cloud githubusercontent com assets 482957 11395769 301ee8cc 936d 11e5 9323 1b376d39f1e9 jpg you can notice how lines of text break when block decoration begins and how they resume later when the decoration ends this hypothethical abstraction would cover several scenarios for package authors among which show diffs show previews and more generally provide richer experience within the editor this primitive would cover only decorations in between screen rows that is users won be able to insert inline elements between `s inside screen row by using block decoration api the code for using this api could look like the following am also thinking to provide shorthand for the above code but guess like to see how this gets used before dealing with this kind of extra details although prefer the latter version more in terms of readability book also feel like we might take this bit further by enforcing better separation of concerns between the model and the view by avoiding to pass an element as the `item` when decorating the marker and using the `viewregistry` instead this seems to stray from how we implemented other decoration apis so take this thought with grain of salt performance we would need to know the whole content height in advance in order to show the appropriate vertical scrollbar right now we measure dummy line height and calculate `dummylineheight model getscreenlinecount if we introduced this kind of custom content however we need to measure block decorations upfront and then calculate height like `dummylineheight model getscreenlinecount measuredblockdecorationsheight` when having lots of these loading refreshing them could become problematic on the core side the scrollbar problem seems the only issue preventing block decorations to be fetched rendered and measured incrementally as we do for other decorations we might even argue that people are used to this sort of progressive content loading on the web thus making this non problem but heart to have some more feedback on this for example what about minimap would think that it will need to know block decorations height in advance rather than as the user scrolls another optimization tactic we could employ is to split up the measurement tasks in chunks to be executed across multiple animation frames to tell the truth believe we should just go for the measure everything upfront approach first see how that feels and then re iterate on that later if needed racehorse styling because of shadow dom we will have to insert elements outside the shadow root and find way to teleport them in the right spot inside the editor content the most straightforward way of doing this could be the following ux when block decoration above the current scroll area changes its height we need to make sure to adjust the current scroll position seamlessly so that the editor doesn scroll down when the user is for example editing something question what about the gutter should we have block decorations in there as well naming should we consider other names for this api block decoration seems pretty sensible choice to me as it seems to reflect css semantics for elements with `display block` style what do you think bulb feedback is super welcome sparkles bow cc nathansobo maxbrunsfeld atom feedback >>>api proposal

atom as an editor is too big compare to sublime is 2mb install size atom is 208m vs sublime3 is 17m run like trying to understand why it so large it seems nodejs project embedding nodejs v0 10 40 binaries and suffering the same nodejs project recursive node modules problem the largest ones are app asar 72m apm 33m and node binaries 16m 11m and there are 90 node modules directories totally from 277 to unique 223 package names means lot of potential duplicate code the app asar 72m resource file seems to be large plain text file with 16 bytes binary header is that webpack or something don understand look like plain text javascript file why it needs to be 72mb large why not try some xz or gzip compressed resource could you atom developers try to reduce the size is there any one making effort on any node dedupe solution if can compare with sublime anyway keep install size below 100m or even smaller would be much appreciated thanks>>>feedback

atom startup perf question why do see blank screen for multiple seconds clock10 when booting new atom session tldr most of the startup time is spent requiring modules and deadlocked in node js

paint happen at this point we have pretty good picture of where the time is being spent on startup in the most ideal of situations where user does not have pile of plugins or custom themes to further slow it down screen shot 2015 11 20 at 13 53 am https cloud githubusercontent com assets 883126 11307762 07e07d14 8f6f 11e5 8f61 6b7f8a5eb306 png looking into the work that is happening inside of setup window prior to painting we can break the 200 ms down into specific segments of work that perhaps could happen after the initial paint thus prioritizing when we draw the ui to the user before loading additional modules and doing work that is blocking screen shot 2015 11 20 at 33 18 am https cloud githubusercontent com assets 883126 11307766 12c780b0 8f6f 11e5 91e5 07498a5b3563 png so with all of this information it is clear that we are paying significant cost due to the number of modules that are being required and time being spent inside of the require load dance prior to even trying to run any js one fun downfall of putting all of the requires at the top of all of your js files the profile deep dive does raise the question of how much of this require work can be pushed off to happen async after the initial paint would it be possible to precompile all of the js used in atom into single blob to avoid the fixed require cost how much of progressive experience is acceptable for plugins can we load them in after the fact or will this be too strange overall this profile shows that there is nothing that atom is doing wrong there are just some interesting performance costs that most developers we never run into or care about given that the difference between 200ms and 500ms startup is not something to spend time reworking the world around however for text editor where users are constantly opening new windows it can become quite noticeable and annoying welp hopefully this is helpful sparkles thanks again to paulirish and all of the awesome folks at github and atom

problem with horizontal scroll in specific condition have created file to replicate this problem here https gist github com mssio 2e559b6d53de7a2e2438 before you copy the content of the files in atom please make sure that the width of your atom window is not super wide can display more than 150 chars and the height of your atom window is not super tall can display more than 60 lines also make sure that the atom configuration on soft wrap is turned off after you copy the file you can see on line everything is normal you can use horizontal scroll and continue typing on line and automatically scrolled to follow the cursor but let try to see the line 105 in that line we can do horizontal scroll and if type on that line the window will not follow the cursor this is really annoying problem because lot of my code have format like this and when am in the middle bottom will not be able to edit the code using atom have to switch to another text editor hope this is not duplicate issue please just close it if it is duplicate and am sorry for my bad english >>>bug

add linux archive to distribute atom now that atom has relocable portable config directories and different channels it makes sense to have way to distribute an archive on linux as suggested on bug 7102 containing latest available code for each channels this has two advantages this will enable in later step to enable auto upgrade to follow multiple channels optionally in parallel in different directories we can even think giving way for people to switch between channels as needed given the user config stay backward compatible happy to work on those problematics after if this pr is merged at some point if all dependencies are installed in the distribution the atom installation is then just question of extracting an archive requiring non root permission contrary to the deb or rpm packages we can then integrate this archive to be downloaded to some tools like ubuntu make https github com ubuntu ubuntu make issues we generate tar gz compressed archive we could switch to more performant tar xz but the first format is more widespread and usual did add the `mktar` to the `ci task` saw the rpm wasn in there so guess it only running on an ubuntu machine and tested it did add the task as well to `upload assets` but of course couldn test it the changes there are though minimal but can modify what necessary as needed as version contains upstream version channel name didn change anything in the naming of the archive publication and the folder in archive contains thus an uniquely defined build of course the resulting archive is linked against the libraries available in the builder version mktar is run where the deb is built which is guess the latest ubuntu lts tried the built archive on 14 04 lts 15 04 15 10 and xenial dev version and everything is working as expected if this doesn work on other distros which looking at the deps seems unlikely and we already only have one deb for debian ubuntu and one rpm for fedora opensuse we can build multiple archives but propose we starts with this one happy to do any changes that you feel are necessary >>>needs-review

multiple crashes on windows 10 atom crashes on startup on windows it happens about once per week and the only solution is to delete the whole atom directory can understand what triggers the problem sometimes it happens after installing new package but removing it and clearing everything inside compile cache won solve the problem sometimes it just happens out of nowhere one day it works and the next it won open sorry can be more helpful in describing the issue but can narrow it down to specific event the last crashes were today 11 03 october 28th and october 15th running atom on windows 10 the editor loads and it shows and empty pane and the menu bar on top only shows the atom tab but then it stays idle for few seconds and then windows notifies that the program froze >>>needs-reproduction

positioning caret in ctl text use this sample hebrew rtl starting from the extreme left would expect right arrow either to move the cursor to the next visual position that is between the and the or jump to what is the next logical position between the and the instead atom doesn move the cursor at all functionally however it has moved between the and the dagesh middle dot similarly if hit the right arrow again the cursor stays at point but logically it is now between the qamets the vowel point beneath the and the dagesh this gets interesting when you hit the right arrow third time the cursor now moves between the and the but logically it is actually between the and the and if you hit backspace it will remove the qamets this issue reported from https github com atom atom issues 4007>>>bug editor-rendering

request for markdown scroll sync in core this is formal request for functioning markdown scroll sync to be included in the atom core the lack of scroll sync and decent markdown editing like you have macdown for example is real killer for me being able to tolerate atom and sure not alone this is especially concerning considering that github itself has made such push to have markdown become standard and is quite incredible that it has had to fall to members of the community such as mark hahn with markdown scroll sync to implement features such as this themselves instead of being created by the core dev team the existing package is no longer supported by the original author and it doesn appear anyone has stepped up to try and improve on the current state of things furthermore this package at least in my experience tried on multiple machines and over many version of atom works tentatively at best with jerky and at times inaccurate sync and at the worst just doesn work at all or repeatedly crashes any input on this suggestion would be welcome because want to get the ball rolling again on making atom great editor for markdown any input on this suggestion would be welcome because want to get the ball rolling again on making atom great editor >>>duplicate wrong-repo

proposal marker layers supplants 9137 find and replace currently scales poorly with the number of results based on test of searching for the `e` character in `jquery js` that took 2932ms the biggest bottlenecks as follows 670ms 20 creating and subscribing to individual decorations for each result 1752ms 60 creating markers of which 893ms inserting markers into current marker index 533ms propagating marker creation events 125ms translating character offsets to rows and columns based on discussion with maxbrunsfeld and as cii this is proposal for changes to core apis that attacks these bottlenecks directly marker layers `textbuffer prototype addmarkerlayer` creates and returns `markerlayer` object that represents set of markers creating markers this object has `markrange` method that takes 2d rows column range as normal but it also has `markcharacterindexrange` that will eliminate the need to translate character indices to points during our scan both marker creation methods return an integer id instead of an object which can be passed to `getmarker` to retrieve the actual marker object for direct manipulation working in terms of ids rather than objects saves us from allocating large quantities of what are essentially convenience objects until they are needed we could potentially avoid the need to ever allocate marker objects by manipulating individual markers via methods on `markerlayer` that take an id such as `updatemarkerrange id range or `destroymarker id however this may interact poorly with existing apis and would need to be carefully considered observing updates `markerlayer`s will also have an asynchronous batch oriented change subscription function called `onupdate` for more information on our need to transition asynchronous events in the model and the naming scheme that could facilitate this transition see 9207 subscribers to `onupdate` will be called once for any number of marker changes occurring in given tick of the event loop if needed we can emit an event object containing arrays of `created` `updated` and `destroyed` marker ids but since the view re queries the marker index anyway during render we may want to wait until we have use case do however have feeling that subscribers could be interested in this information decorating marker layers to avoid the overhead of creating and subscribing to thousands of decorations we can add `texteditor decoratemarkerlayer` that accepts marker layer along with decoration descriptor object that should apply to every range in that layer this will allow us to create and decorate the search results layer once and from then on just manipulate markers other methods markers created via `textbuffer` existing `markrange` method will be created in default marker layer which can be accessed via `textbuffer prototype getdefaultmarkerlayer` otherwise don think we need to provide accessors or observation methods for marker layers as they can be explicitly passed to functions that need them finally `markerlayer` will need the utility methods `clear` and `destroy` creating markers in the background finally if the overhead of inserting markers into the index is still too slow using the new 1d marker index and avoiding the overhead of synchronous events we re going to need to populate it in the background this would add two complementary methods to the `markerlayer` `serialize` and `deserialize` they would delegate through to our marker index object which we could construct directly in the `scandal` background process and then serialize to be populated into highlighted marker layer after the scan completed >>>api performance proposal
proposal model change observation should be batch oriented and asynchronous we ve gained lot of performance in atom by switching from processing events synchronously and one at time to processing events asynchronously and in batches asynchrony and batching in the view layer originally we mapped individual changes to the editor model directly to individual updates to the dom synchronously now when the text editor model changes we schedule an asynchronous batched update of the view on the next animation frame we write this view update as straightforward function of the underlying data model adding indexes to the model where necessary to ensure we can recompute the view efficiently an asynchronous approach means that model updates have very predictable performance for any given operation we update small chunk of essential state along with any indexes and both of these operations can be made log or better in the size of the essential state of the model importantly these update operations do not synchronously fire event handlers that interact with the dom eliminating the risk of subscriber unexpectedly adding to the cost of particular update operation code that responds to changes is decoupled from code that makes changes meaning that once we make our operations fast they will stay that way the cost of updating the view is also easier to reason about in batched model we can write computation that performs predictably regardless of how many times the model has been updated since the last animation frame redundant dom updates are avoided and we can reason about the state of the view holistically and declaratively rather than concerning ourselves with the interactions of lots of individual updates making all model events asynchronous so far we ve really only applied this approach to the view layer but it makes sense at the model layer as well currently we expose synchronous event hooks all over the system for example we emit events when individual text changes are made to the buffer when individual cursors move and for each individual change of the active pane these synchronous events make the cost of model changes open ended and encourage redundant computation in layers of derived state for example commenting out 1000 lines currently causes 1000 individual text changes each of which is processed through the tokenized buffer and display buffer as separate event and that not even accounting for the cost of third party event handlers the solution is to make event propagation at the model layer asynchronous and batch oriented in the same way we ve done at the view layer instead of events synchronously reporting on individual changes such as `marker prototype ondidupdate` and `marker prototype ondiddestroy` events should instead asynchronously describe groups of changes that have occurred within given frame of time such as hypothetical `markerlayer prototype onupdate` that emitted events with list of `created` `updated` and `destroyed` markers to achieve and maintain performance in atom we need to systematically replace all synchronous event subscription points in the system starting with the hottest code paths highest on my list are atom synchronous handling of individual marker events which degrades the scalability of find and replace along with our synchronous handling of buffer changes which causes bad performance in the face of large numbers of text changes scheduling model change events going asynchronous means we can deliver change events at any time so when should we do so updating the view is the ultimate goal of most model changes meaning that the frequency with which we emit change events should be bounded by 60 frames per second or roughly 16 milliseconds however since model level change events often themselves result in additional model changes emitting events at higher frequency will be necessary to allow chained model updates to quiesce before the end of the frame budget simply emitting events on `nexttick` may be sufficient transitioning to asynchronous model change events ton of code has been written against atom synchronous model change subscription methods so dropping them any time soon is pretty much out of the question new asynchronous apis will need to be added alongside them and after we transition bundled packages over we can deprecate the old synchronous versions good way to slot these methods in may be with shift in our naming previously we adopted the `ondid and `onwill nomenclature to distinguish events occurring before or after specific moment in time since asynchronous events always occur after it may make sense to just drop the did from the name adopting scheme like `textbuffer prototype onchange` or `textbuffer prototype onupdatemarkers` there will be inconsistency during the transition but eventually only few `onwill special methods that actually allow synchronous cancellation will remain alongside host of `on methods >>>api performance proposal

api proposal decoration layers note this document is currently aspirational and describes the hypothetical design of an api that is yet to be implemented cc as cii maxbrunsfeld overview decoration layers provide an alternative api to marker based decorations for situations in which creating markers is too expensive two examples are spell check and find and replace with decoration layers instead of creating marker for every single decoration in the buffer package authors can perform work incrementally to describe only the decorations for the currently visible portion of the buffer creating decoration layer decoration layers are created by calling the `adddecorationlayer` method with single function returning decorations when necessary the editor will call this function with `range` object representing the currently visible portion of the screen in buffer coordinates full range is used rather than row numbers because due to soft wrapping only portion of line in the buffer might be visible buffer coordinates are used rather than screen coordinates because they map more directly to most kinds of analyses required for decorations such as scanning for search matches or highlighting misspellings to ensure smooth visual experience the decoration layer function is synchronous we may want to discuss allowing decoration layers to return promises but this would lead to decorations flickering into view and is unacceptable for our initial use cases the return value of decoration layer function should be an array of decoration descriptor objects each descriptor can contain any of the parameters passed to `decoratemarker` to create marker based decorations such as `type` `class` etc in addition each descriptor object must contain `bufferrange` key describing the range to which the decoration applies returned ranges should all overlap with the `visiblebufferrange` passed to the function decoration layer methods the `decorationlayer` object returned by the call to `adddecorationlayer` has two methods `update` and `destroy` decoration layer functions will be called automatically when the contents of their editor changes when decorations change for other reasons you ll need to manually inform the editor that your layer needs to be re rendered by calling `update` this method is asynchronous meaning call to update only schedules view update for the next animation frame we can potentially return promise that resolves when the update is completed if it needed to remove the decoration layer call `destroy` on it implementation interpolation decoration layers need to be fast enough not to impose undue overhead when the visible range changes on the editor however performing full screen search on every keystroke is untenable the solution to this problem is interpolation when the buffer changes should debounce calls into user defined decoration functions so as to only perform them at the end of sequence of changes in the meantime we ll want to keep decorations in the correct logical location during edits by maintaining local marker index when changes occur to the buffer we ll apply them to the layer marker index synchronously but we won re query the user defined function for each change like to use this as chance to test drive our new marker index https github com atom marker index library changes will need to be converted to absolute coordinates in order to use it but it the cleanest and fastest implementation and like to migrate to using it in `textbuffer` if it works out in this use case we shouldn store decorations as markers on the `textbuffer` because there ton of overhead associated with creating mutable markers that unnecessary in this case interacting at low level directly with an index will have much lower overhead to avoid the need to row and column based points to absolute character offsets repeatedly we may want to change the buffer apis to include offset information we ll need to calculate this information in the buffer anyway to accomodate use of the new marker index another tool that might be useful to aggregate changes is patch data structure https github com nathansobo atom patch this allows sequence of potentially overlapping splice operations to be recorded into the patch and then be played back in coalesced form asynchronously including the offset information and just writing synchronously into the marker index is probably easier but it worth keeping in mind that an efficient change tracking data structure exists updates to the view model relationship currently we return visible decorations from the model to the view in an object that indexed by marker id think we should add new private method to the model that intended to be consumed by the view it should return an array of decoration descriptors each containing range so that the view layer no longer needs to interact with markers this will make it possible to unify our handling of marker and layer based decorations in the view in single code path the model will be in charge of querying the marker store and decoration layers and combining everything into single array of data to be consumed >>>api

for unicode atom doesnt have concept of canonical equivalence or compatibility the underlying error for this issue causes multiple bugs as outlined below canonical equivalence issue consider the following two canonically equivalent code sequences `n 0061 0301 `o 00e1 in the following snippet of text the first line uses `n` but not `o` and the second line uses `n` but not `o` asdfasdfasdf aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa asdfasdfasdf if one enables soft wrap and sizes the window appropriately theyll notice that the first line wraps before the second line wraps as shown in the following image it seems as though atom navely calculates `n` as two separate characters would expect atom to treat it as single character additionally if one resizes the window appropriately they can see that the second code point in `n` can be separated and wrapped independent of the first code point as shown in the following image obviously atom does not do this for `o` this lack of canonical equivalence can also be demonstrated via the search feature as shown in the following images neither `n` is considered match for `o` nor vice versa atom should either match all characters that have that code point in the code sequence or all characters whose entire code sequence is match in regard to the third following image do not currently have guess as to what could cause the depicted result in regard to fix for this bug note that the following code sequences though visually `q u` are in fact all considered canonically equivalent `q 0061 0301 0305 should render as `r 0061 0305 0301 should render as `s 0101 305 should render as `t 0227 0301 should render as `u 01e1 should render as note that `r` does not render correctly as shown in the following image upon initial research this seems to occur for all characters in which the subsequent code points in the corresponding code sequence are not in ascending order compatibility issue compatibility comes into play for characters that might have distinguishable appearances but have the same meaning compatible characters are not necessarily canonically equivalent but canonically equivalent characters are always compatible as understand consider the typographic ligature code sequence fb00 the string ff code sequence 00ff 00ff is compatible with the ligature however in this particular case care should be taken to not consider them compatible if the latter one is followed by combining character note that compatible sequences shouldnt always necessarily be treated the same way it depends on the situation similar issues this appears to be related to 1783 but based on my findings these appear to be separate bugs 1783 appears to be caused by inconsistent character widths in the font this issue differs in that code points are not being properly combined it appears that there are many duplicates of 1783 that are unrelated to this issue some of the duplicates even initially appear similar to this one at first glance this appears related to 1894 but do not believe that they are related in any way there seem to be many issues related to this but none touch on the underlying problem of this one unicode equivalence closing remarks partial solution would be to normalize the underlying representation of the text users might expect the code sequences to not be modified so that would introduce challenge in terms of memory or efficiency fix should only be effective for unicode codings at the time of this writing the only supported unicode encodings are utf utf 16 be and utf 16 le since this is silent semantic issue there are no error reports to include all of the screenshots and described behavior are from atom 15 on os yosemite 10 10 no changes to the ui switching themes directly modifying the theme etc seem to affect any of the aforementioned issues more information in regard to the unicode aspect can be found in chapter of the unicode standard version core specification http www unicode org versions unicode7 ch03 pdf additionally an overview can be found on the unicode equivalence article on wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki unicode equivalence >>>atom

dom based measurements supersedes and closes 6083 supersedes and closes 7945 brief flashback over the past month we have evaluated several strategies to attack the problem among which iframe build the lines inside an element and measure from them pros measurements happen in separate context completely decoupled from the current dom some optimization can therefore be applied skinnier dom less stylesheet and so on cons building the lines twice has cost which is higher than the optimizations we tried out moreover we cannot alter the original dom structure as otherwise measurements could be wrong canvas have canvas element and use the `measuretext` function to provide all the metrics we need to position visual elements pros measurements happen in separate context and the overhead is minimal cons css typography is not fully supported ligatures contextual alternates get screwed up and the risk of reporting corrupted measurements is very high no measurements instead of positioning decorations cursors etc with absolute coordinates embed them inside each line and let the browser figure out all the metrics pros no need for measurements and more semantical html in addition this enriches the power of styling customizations the user has the possibility to style piece of text surrounded by decoration cons worse performance because the dom gets more complicated and nesting increases overlays need to be displayed on top of lines node which forces us to employ tricks to let them appear in front of everything the present in this pr we have implemented dom based measurements the idea here is to append the real lines to the dom measure from them and render everything else that needs measurements every time `texteditorelement pixelpositionforscreenposition` or `texteditorelement screenpositionforpixelposition` is called we trigger reflow bit like the dom does when you try to read from it when its information is stale in `texteditorpresenter` we update the dom with all lines we ll need to measure before computing any state in order to avoid multiple reflows caused by reading from line nodes more than once what missing autoscroll when reaching the right end of the editor implement `screenpositionforpixelposition` in `linesyardstick` fix remaining specs avoid using `nodeiterator` as it is slow cache text nodes and measure those instead evaluate if caching already computed positions yields some improvements remove measurement in `texteditorcomponent readafterupdatesync` ensure we have no significant regression performance wise investigate why hasklig behaves oddly fix bug where the cursor disappears when moving it left right arrow up autocomplete plus arrow up wrap guide feedback is super welcome and appreciated thanks bow cc nathansobo atom feedback for eyes >>>needs-review needs-testing

remove jquery from atom core this has been long time coming made the early mistake of basing atom initial view system spacepen on jquery which solves lot of problems that aren at all relevant when targeting single modern browser engine last summer we removed the reliance on jquery from atom public api and setup pretty complicated layer of shims to keep the old jquery based views working through the deprecation period with that finally behind us this pr will remove jquery and spacepen entirely we ll need to transition bundled packages away from spacepen to finally get the benefit of reduced require time by not loading jquery but this is first step some things to note our default tooltips are based on bootstrap which ships its tooltip support as jquery plugin reworked their code to remove the dependency on jquery which could slightly alter couple corners of the api it would be great if people could help me test that the new tooltips work correctly in all cases some of our rarely used global spec helpers have been removed the last incomplete step is to switch our test reporter from spacepen to raw dom apis do worry that old packages that depend on jquery might break in unforeseen ways since we were augmenting the jquery that shipped with spacepen with extra stuff for example we had shimmed `trigger` to run atom commands but that no longer works not totally sure what going to happen but most packages developed in newer styles should have nothing to do with this >>>work-in-progress

project find and replace improvements although really glad switched from netbeans to atom and love many things about it do miss some features in the project wide find replace functionality so will try to list them here think the results screen shouldn be normal tab because sometimes it harder to find it when many taps are open think it better to have results as panel instead of normal tab should be able to have multiple search replace instances without having to reuse the same instance sometimes you want to search for multiple keywords and currently only able to have one search instance at time when replacing it very important to be able to select or filter out some results it really sucks when want to replace 99 results from 100 and cancel the whole thing just for one result want to skip that my basic thoughts and after discussing we can find more specific features and can then split them into different features or tickets now really have to go back to work >>>wrong-repo

gutter line number width minimum two characters this is suggestion the space for line numbers in the gutter should be at least two characters wide so that the transition from lines to 10 doesn change the gutter width the reasoning goes like this this transition happens when we ve just started writing new file it is quite likely few files are below lines and can be distracting unexpected movement in peripheral vision was torn out of concentration by this sudden movement once too many times so now have this in my `styles less` but that feels sub optimal even better but much harder to implement would be width that smoothly increases it could be set to log10 lines ch again minimum 2ch so that gutter width never jumps during normal editing >>>enhancement

copy paste doesn work properly with unix style line endings under windows copying ctrl ctrl from file with unix style line ending lf doesn work as expected since line endings are preserved on the clipboard this causes wide range of issues you can paste text in an application that doesn handle lf notepad for example but if you re using vim over putty that also doesn work even if the other app handles lf you have to be consistent so you can paste text from an crlf file into lf one or vice versa this issue is briefly discussed in 2822 and it is the reason of 5808 all other editors convert line endings in text placed on the clipboard sublime text jedit etc so in this regard atom behaves rather strangely compared to other editors the proposed solution in 2822 configurable line endings is insufficient since it based on the assumption that all files edited by the user are using the same line ending for example if ve got file with lf line endings and like to use copy paste then have to convert it to crlf and then copy the text want and then convert it back to lf to preserve the original format wouldn call editing lf files on windows rare use case especially among atom users atom should convert any text line ending to the platform native line ending before it is placed on the clipboard this conversion should only be done on the content that is placed on the clipboardthe text in the buffer should not be changed >>>bug

introduce scheme to `npm dedupe` npm dependencies of atom packages currently the organization of the atom packages` directory makes it impossible to dedupe dependencies potentially causing lot of bloat specifically in the case of nuclide we have our `nuclide installer` https atom io packages nuclide installer package that is used to install our collection of nuclide packages in the most recent release of nuclide v0 26 there are 17 such packages to install https github com facebooknuclideapm nuclide installer blob v0 26 lib config json the way `nuclide installer` works is that it starts up and then runs `apm install` for each package in that `config json` file on my machine where npm` was already populated with all of the dependencies used by these packages it took `nuclide installer` minutes to install all 17 atom packages and the resulting atom packages` directory was 903m that enormous this is bad for several reasons 903m is an order of magnitude more disk space than is necessary if dependencies could be de duped the installation process is much slower than it has to be much more javascript code has to be loaded at runtime suspect that the javascript in atom packages` is not loaded as efficiently as the javascript in applications atom app contents resources app asar` putting third party code at even more of disadvantage suspect that the only thing can do right now without any changes to atom is have atom nuclide installer` create special directory structure under itself maybe something like where npm packages common to multiple nuclide atom packages would be written to atom nuclide installer node modules obviously there could only be one version per common dependency and then each atom package would be in its own directory under atom nuclide installer node modules atom packages under that scheme only an npm dependency that already had an entry under atom nuclide installer node modules would also have to exist under atom nuclide installer node modules atom packages node modules` if different version were required once everything was in place `nuclide installer` would run `apm link` for each entry in atom nuclide installer node modules atom packages` while rubber ducking https en wikipedia org wiki rubber duck debugging would probably add another directory of indirection so that the directory structure would be parameterized by version number this way `nuclide installer` could be writing out v0 27 and would not switch over until all of the files were in place this is really important for nuclide so willing to hack this into `nuclide installer` but it would be nice if there were way for atom to support this natively so that others could also provide package bundles efficiently for atom >>>enhancement

search bar is too eager when start searching inside large file or in small file with long lines that atom hates so much atom starts to lag because it immediately scans the whole file even for the first character let say want to search in 2k line javascript file for something like if atom will start searching the whole file for all if then for all if all if and so on that can get really laggy if want to search for something that starts with whitespace can even crash atom when there are thousands of whitespaces in one file know if you type very fast you don get that problem but unless you search for words like function etc you won be fast enough to keep atom from auto searching my suggestion don automatically search inputs below characters if search for just one single character is ever necessary hitting the return key or clicking the find button should not be too much to ask or include settings option to disable auto search below certain number of characters >>>duplicate wrong-repo
option for zero indexed line numbers ve always wanted zero indexed line numbers that what used to other than nutty environments like excel applescript matlab etc arrays are always zero indexed but perplexingly no programmer editor supports them zero indexed line numbers make counting lines sets of lines and newline characters easier since the line number is literally the index of the line the correspondence is so well suited that pointer index arithmetic carries over seamlessly and this would be exceptionally easy to implement in the core >>>enhancement

the quality initiative the atom team will be focusing on quality for the next month or so this effort is timeboxed the plan is to finish around the beginning of sept this means we probably won get everything done on this list during the allotted time window after this time window unfinished things will work into our normal issue handling routine what does this mean the goal of the quality initiative is to focus on fixing bugs and adding features that impact lot of people but are reasonably low effort why there are lot of low effort things affecting many people and lot of issues that slipped through the cracks while we were focused on the api and we re just giving our selves some time to focus on them these will be small projects ideally days max we will avoid rewrites or major refactoring the quality initiative will be our main focus but we will still handle issues and review prs mdash think of this effort as our 80 time what about bug feature after this quality initiative we plan on shifting our 80 time to focus on things like performance https github com atom atom issues 307 better support for international users https github com atom atom keymap issues 37 and some features we have in mind if you know of bug or feature that is high impact low effort not in the list below and does not fall under performance or internationalization comment on this issue and we ll

character measurements iframe this pr is intended to supersede 6083 please note that its still construction worker work in progress construction worker and as result there are still some minor hiccups and few performance regressions which am going to expound later in this description background have look at 6055 to get sense of why we want to do this nathansobo did great job at explaining the drawbacks of the current approach and how we could possibly solve them so strongly recommend to read that issue in depth solution the idea with the approach proposed in this pr is to have an independent context where we can arbitrarily build bunch of dom nodes exclusively for measuring purposes we employed an for this so that reflow in the measurement context does not affect the main document and viceversa to accomplish this we have introduced `linesyardstick` naming is hard sweat smile an abstraction whose purpose is to hide the complexity of dealing with the measurement context housekeeping the api is simple `builddomnodesforscreenrows` `leftpixelpositionforscreenposition` we need to explicitly have two separate steps as otherwise wed end up continously changing the dom and reading from it thus causing extra reflows the measurement context the context as stated previously is an that replicates some of the functionalities featured on the fully fledged document namely has bunch of line nodes includes custom element which contains font size information includes which in turn contains the syntax theme you can think of it as skinny replica of the larger document where line characters occupy the exact same space and are therefore measurable its extremely important for this context to be independent as we will use it in `texteditorpresenter` as well as in `displaybuffer` in the future performance side note this section is collection of personal thoughts and may not be accurate or necessarily correct however it will hopefully serve as starting point for further optimizations and discussions we have encountered several performance regressions along the way especially for performance sensitive scenarios such as scrolling keep in mind that for such intensive activities we need to respect the 16ms budget as of today the steps we perform are the following right before updating at the beginning of `texteditorpresenter getstate` we build the dom nodes for bunch of screen rows we know we are going to measure all the rows that will be rendered on screen after the update to make sure decorations cursors etc will be able to measure stuff the longest row to calculate the maximum width of the open document the last cursor row to calculate the hidden input position as we update things updatedecorations` updatecursors` we call pixelpositionforscreenposition` which in turn will query `linesyardstick` for positions the first time this method is called `recalculate style` and `layout` will be triggered these are the two main operations and you can see how they perform on quite heavy scrolling session profiler disabled to avoid performance overhead screen shot 2015 07 17 at 11 59 41 https cloud githubusercontent com assets 482957 8744934 5ed3ee00 2c7b 11e5 8e9a accb2552ba9e png and if we zoom in one of those spikes screen shot 2015 07 17 at 12 01 21 https cloud githubusercontent com assets 482957 8744964 90306546 2c7b 11e5 8a9c d65e38a71eff png the first half of the picture is the illustration of the aforementioned steps building html `1 33ms` parsing html `1 28ms` recalculate style `0 839ms` layout `1 408ms` the whole frame took `20ms` measuring the first half via chrome shift click reported `6ms` now the question is what could we improve there are couple of possibilities build the same html for the lines in the context as well as for the lines in the real document this way we can avoid reparsing the lines twice although cloning the nodes still takes some time not sure if this is really useful build skinnier lines for the measurement context ideally we should avoid as much nesting as possible and reducing the scopes complexity by building only those ones needed for styling could improve that it also true that it would complicate things bit involves dealing with css rules etc eb8a1c0 be smarter about updates instead of including every possible line we build and layout only those lines needed for position based updates the drawback here is that when we have decoration for each visible row this optimization is useless this means want to make sure to speedup the current process instead of relying on not having certain rows anyway this improvement has positive impact on `layout` `recalculate style` and html manipulation to get sense of what this could look like here relevant snippet

getlastcursor getscreenrange measurablerows add lastcursorrange start row measurablerows add lastcursorrange end row if longestscreenrow model getlongestscreenrow measurablerows add longestscreenrow measurablerows cut non syntax css from styles removing does not yield huge speedups so am not sure it the first thing we want to improve still an improvement id like to make though 2257688 reduce layout times by trying to modify the measurement context without affecting the whole document if we manage to always change the dom in way that affects only smaller layout boundaries we may be able to halve reflow times 28405e09afe097a8f40f90cb2166a47619c8feef believe combination of and could be interesting html creation and parsing and `layout` are the expensive operations right now and am thinking to ways in which we could speed them up am still kinda making some research but feel we could reach decent performance if we put some more effort on this ll investigate other potential speedups in the meantime nathansobo what do you think conclusion if you have read everything so far extremely appreciate your attention feel like there are many ways to solve this problem none of which is guaranteed to be the right one thus wanted to include as much of my knowledge as possible so that you and the future me can try things out based on it pray any feedback would be much

panes redundancy in close other pane items tabs there have been requests for an emacs like behavior of `ctrl 1` that would close inactive panes and the closest approach is the close other items but it only closes inactive items within the active pane to that end the tabs module provides close other tabs function that does exactly the same thing the pane function close other items could either be omitted or replaced with close other panes function which would make emacs users happy multiple items within pane does not seem to have purpose without some implementation of tabs in that case in my opinion it should be up to the tabs implementation to provide the close other items feature >>>feedback

issues with cursor focus after changing syntax or encoding from the status bar after setting syntax or file encoding from the menus in the status bar the cursor focus stays in the status bar and to move focus back to the file with keyboard only you need to press tab key twice after setting syntax or thrice after setting encoding imho it would be better to move the cursor focus to its last position in the file window even though the focus is retained coloured outline after completing syntax encoding change there is no way to bring up these menus with enter key or other key combinations that ve tried if you decide to move cursor focus to file the status bar menu outline should be removed if you decide to keep the focus in the status bar the focus appearance could be improved in appearance currently it doesn look bad but it could at least use some padding on the sides of the focused item screen shot 2015 07 01 at 08 57 29 https cloud githubusercontent com assets 654500 8449160 3cdf8d94 1fcf 11e5 8d70 5850454550d6 png lastly setting syntax encoding should be available from the command palette perhaps the same way as in sublime text showing all entries prefixed appropriately or just way to trigger the selection menus as they exist now atom on osx 10 10 >>>duplicate wrong-repo

bundle linter in the core atom is code editor ide for developers and those developers make mistakes base linter provider is something that everyone needs there was time when `linter` api and codebase wasn shiny enough for it to be made part of core but now we have rebuilt the `linter` package from the ground and consumed the latest technologies services to provide api to linters it api api and other docs can be found in the linter plus linter plus wiki it api is inspired from the awesome `autocomplete plus` the rewrite also features completely new ui based on suggestions from the atomlinter org members and styles from simurai furthermore it accepts anonymous objects as messages allowing the providers to write unit tests it also has ui to show errors from the current file or project which is very important for the nuclide ide and project based languages like flowjs hacklang and others and the error objects can contain traces that expand over the lines it is also extremely easy to style and it doesn have to save temp file to disk to lint files it also supports `lintonfly` and `onsave` linters it even exports it self service to packages who have daemons in separate processes and want to trigger lint without waiting for save or change in the buffer also in the tooltip and bottom panel are positions that user can click on and be directed to the file line col instead of just jumping to the next error all these features remove all of the known limitations of old `linter` package note it also backward compatible so all the linters using the old api will still work here is how it looks like at the moment screenshot from 2015 06 20 19 09 10 https cloud githubusercontent com assets 4278113 8269940 e232c69c 177f 11e5 8710 8b2acf1380fb png there are lot of packages that have re invented the wheel and written their own error uis if we merge `linter` in the core all those packages can consume similar api and eventually reduce their code complexity things to be done make the code shine bright we have been working hard hard on this one move it to the `atom` org let us know what you guys think linter plus https github com atomlinter linter plus api https github com atomlinter linter plus wiki linter api hard https github com atomlinter linter plus graphs>>>enhancement

plugin tooltips api change was this intentional hi recently the tooltips for types in both the atom typescript and omnisharp atom plugins broke simultaneously in recent versions of atom regardless of where the scroll position was in the file the tooltips displayed by these plugins would be appropriate for what appeared at the top and leftmost screenfull of the file based on the mouse position for example examplebadtooltip https cloud githubusercontent com assets 3755379 8022613 7f25bd5e 0cab 11e5 9501 e2e20f23ef11 png the `icompilepromise` tooltip was appropriate for that position on line 17 of the file not line 207 we reported it here https github com typestrong atom typescript issues 381 and came up with this fix https github com typestrong atom typescript pull 384 which was adding these two lines in the code that determines the mouse position these tooltips had been working correctly up until perhaps week or two ago suspect this was due to some sort of change in atom to the output of `getboundingclientrect or `editor screenpositionforpixelposition or `editor bufferpositionforscreenposition my questions are do you believe that this is correct and if so was this intentional do you think this new behavior will stand or is it bug to my knowledge atom typescript didn have any calls that were marked as deprecated prior to this bug emerging looked through the recent patch notes and didn see anything that sounds like it should have caused this problem thanks >>>question

load path when launched as an app when atom is launched as an application it doesn get the user path because it was launched by `launchctl` this means that packages like script https github com rgbkrk atom script and hydrogen https github com willwhitney hydrogen have to tell the user to launch atom from the command line some packages like hydrogen can even be installed without the path because their dependencies use native extensions built with `node gyp` https github com tootallnate node gyp there exist tools such as `fix path` https github com sindresorhus fix path but they clobber the user path even if they ve set something on purpose with virtualenv having access to the user path will become more and more important as people build packages that interface more deeply with languages other tools and the user environment forcing the user to configure each package with complete paths to the binaries it needs is possible but inelegant and becomes intractable with general purpose tools this seems like clear situation where making this change to atom itself would dramatically simplify life for many packages and eliminate many bugs arising from poor attempts to capture the path >>>enhancement mac

when launched from given directory atom doesn open the corresponding tree anymore hello ve just updated from 193 to 200 on debian jessie when launched from the cli atom used to display the tree view of the current cli directory it is not the case anymore on the first start the tree view is closed in order to display the tree view of given directory you have to manually open file contained into it from that moment on no mater the cli directory atom is launched from it always opens the tree view for the directory containing the latest opened file the only way to open new directory in the tree view from the gui is to right click the current one select remove project folder than open file contained into the desired directory is it bug or feature is there any way to get the previous behavior back >>>duplicate

more flexible open path location parameters when you open an atom path you can optional include an initialline and initialcolumn using the following syntax during the opening process those line column values are stripped off the path and provided as metadata to the workspace opener handler this is useful but the problem is that the syntax is fixed no other values can be passed in other then line column would like atom to also read in url query parameter syntax and send those values through as options to the workspace opener don mean we should break the existing syntax for line column but instead provide an alternative syntax using query parameter syntax for example these would all be equivalent the reason for making this change is because then other workspace openers could could read in similar values that apply to them for example have an outliner editor https atom io packages foldingtext for atom that can filter the outline view with search would like the option to provide an initial search value when opening an outline file similar to how initial line and column is now provided to the default editor if query parameter options were available in atom could then open path like this and `search stuff` would get passed through to my opener as an option the implementation would be pretty strait forward in `atom application coffee locationforpathtoopen` strip and store query parameters key values from the path right before the code that does `pathtoopen pathtoopen replace include those key values along with the initialline and initialcolumn key values that are being returned in `window event handler coffee` process the `open locations` handler bit differently so that all location metadata gets passed through to `atom workspace open` instead of just the line and column >>>enhancement
api request file created event hi have created function to watch changes in the project by given pattern due to the usage of patterns forced to use the ondidchange` of the individual files the problem is that not able to fetch the file created events this way could watch the directory and refresh all watchers on each change but would prefer either own event like onfilecreated` or some parameters passed to the callback of ondidchange` so can filter the created events this is far from high priority but maybe it is easy to implement have looked into the `pathwatcher` and think this feature could be implemented in this line https github com atom node pathwatcher blob v4 src main coffee l96 thanks>>>api enhancement

overflow css property in status bar right` causes unnecessary scroll bars since about version or two ago that noticed anyway on 198 noticed that the bottom right section of the status bar has been adding unnecessary scroll bars and ironically ends up hiding some of the data since the scroll bars take up space setting the `overflow` css property of the class `status bar status bar right` from `auto` to `hidden` fixes the issue but not sure if this rule serves some other purpose the theme using is the one light ui but it might carry over to others as well >>>bug ui

associating atom with text files on windows is very difficult want to open all my text files with atom but couldn find good way to do that that not breaking with every atom update and don get atom icons did do something wrong is there way to make the existing open with atom right click menu entry stick please tell me there more streamlined way to achieve correct file associations on windows expected behaviour either atom offers on installation to associate with files typically edited with text editor or offers setting where you can do that post installation failing that the user is given clear method of associating desired file types with atom using the open with dialog like other editors allow observed behaviour atom is not associated with any files and there no setting to change that there is context menu entry but that requires constant right clicking for every file you want to open in atom so is not really desirable ok so thought manually change the open with choice for every file type to new default setting right click txt file open with set new default application puzzlingly atom is not in the list of proposed applications nevermind let hit further applications and select from there huh atom is not in program files either so that didn work ok then let select the installed desktop link or start menu entry hooray could select it oh it just flickers terminal at you for split second turns out this just calls some update exe and something gets messed up probably command args after some googling found out that atom gets installed in appdata somewhere so let search the exe there erm the exe is in version specific folder so have to re associate all my file bindings after every update no thank you the cmd file in the bin directory is an option but to select that you have to go to the location in separate explorer window to display hidden items to be able to see appdata which you can do in the file selection dialog copy the path to bin navigate the open with dialog until you get to the point where you can select arbitrary files paste the path select atom cmd hooray now can open files with atom all the time but got no way to select the atom icon got an empty white rectangle it flickers the terminal for split second which interestingly does not happen when starting atom via the start menu annoying but not vital it says atom cmd in the relevant dialogs menus which is not exactly beautiful elegant can imagine normal user to go through this dance to do this compared to the experience in other editors like notepad versions windows atom 198 dialog strings translated from german so may not be identical to an english windows >>>duplicate

scrolling behavior while mouse selecting whole lines of text is hard to control atom 196 mac os 10 10 trying to select text that spans more than just the visible scroll region is much more difficult in atom than in other editors when selecting entire lines because of the auto scrolling behavior when you stretch selection past the edge of the scroll region the editor scrolls to accommodate you but once you overshoot your destination pulling back starts scrolling back in the other direction even though it not necessary most other editors will only scroll when necessary steps open file that is at least twice as long as what you can display in your window make sure you re scrolled to the top triple click and hold somewhere to begin selecting entire lines drag down just past the bottom of the window causing the window to scroll once you ve scrolled all the way to the bottom it important here that you scroll at least past the point where the top of the selection scrolls out of the window pretend you overshot the bottom of what you wanted selected by few lines and you actually want the selection to end at the 10th line from the bottom of the file continue to hold the mouse button down while you move your mouse back up to that line observe that if you move your mouse up past about the 4th line from the bottom of the window it actually starts scrolling back up and will keep going until the top of your selection is visible this makes it difficult to get the selection to stop on specific line because you have to time the scrolling to get your target line within lines of the bottom of the window expected after mouse movement downward causes scroll moving the mouse back up into the window should not cause scrolling back in the other direction unless you attempt to move the end of the selection past the top of the visible part of the file >>>bug

show invisibles only when selecting text tried searching for similar issue here and didn find anything that directly addresses what want though 3249 which have subscribed to is what want just asked for in very roundabout way in short we should have an option to only display invisibles within selection showing them all the time is too noisy not showing them at all loses their power and turning them off and on when want to see them is annoying aware that with css we cannot achieve what is required hence unresolved 3249 and accompanying forum post https discuss atom io atom is so powerful that it blows my mind 294 17 due to the underlayer controlling the background highlight so this will presumably be something that atom must provide from within the core if this request appeals more as something that more generic and allow us to achieve what we want with css you could actually just attach selected` class to all elements scopes that are within the selection obviously selection part way through an element will require an inner span injected with just the selected` class this way we can do what we want in regards to the invisibles but package developers may find interesting ways to use this selection class scope for other purposes >>>enhancement

suppressing autoscroll or saving restoring current scroll position in ae4f7f6170da83c786ba06235f0997e52e806b10 global autoscroll suppression mechanism was removed in favour of per call `autoscroll` option in vim mode motions get combined with operations and the yank operation which copies text into clipboard should not always scroll around however there currently seems to be no way of preventing generic cursor movements from autoscrolling nathansobo suggested adding the `autoscroll` option in the various movement methods so looking at this it seems it will require that every method that may move the cursors to accept and pass through an options parameter that feels like an unnecessarily wide reaching contract which affects not only methods in atom core but also in any package that has actions that can move the cursor further some methods like `selection selectline` and `selection inserttext` currently simply assume `autoscroll` should be true and all places like this would need to be revisited nathansobo and maxbrunsfeld there was `editor suppressautoscroll` option in the code introduced in 99c437ccecff469d2fc4ba70ff3ff9a0f694f9e6 and removed again in ae4f7f6170da83c786ba06235f0997e52e806b10 can you please clarify the reasoning there sure missing something alternatively is there public api for getting and setting the current scroll position of the window if so vim mode yank operation could use that >>>api atom enhancement help-wanted

updating atom on windows fails to update open with atom context menu shortcut for directories the open with atom directory context menu shortcut stops working after every atom update because the auto installer fails to update the appropriate windows registry keys the path for the context menu command becomes outdated in theory that means that open with atom should open the old atom version on that directory but in practice it just doesn open anything which is just as bad say atom auto updates to version 192 the atom registry keys should be updated to point to the appropriate executable `` userprofile appdata local atom app 192 atom exe`` the issue is that they aren the registry key locations are hkey classes root directory background shell atom hkey classes root directory background shell atom command hkey classes root directory shell atom hkey classes root directory shell atom command the problem only occurs when open with atom is used on directory as opposed to file >>>installer windows

replace bootstrap css with hand written css designed for atom the bootstrap css is enormous it is designed to solve problem that atom does not have that is set of css rules to normalize presentation across all browsers that may be used for rendering using whatever browser specific hacks necessary to achieve that goal the project was also conceived before the advent of flexbox which means that bootstrap has ton of cruft to deal with pre flexbox browsers such workarounds are verbose and make it difficult to understand what can be removed in sum this puts atom into situation where the css is much larger than what atom needs it requires much more work than should be necessary to understand why the current css works the way it does bootstrap is the source of truth rather than something that is directly under atom control for example take look at the issue recently filed against bootstrap https github com twbs bootstrap issues 16276 the recommended solution is to pile on another hack use an even more specific css selector rather than figure out why the existing css works the way it does and fix the underlying problem with the model presumably this is because trying to untangle why things work the way they do is too hard atom should not be saddled with the baggage of layout engines of old and should be exploiting the fact that it only needs to support blink which supports flexbox and write its own small specific and far more maintainable css >>>enhancement ui

we need better approach to text measurement when chrome 39 added support for subpixel font scaling it broke our approach to horizontal position measurement we disabled subpixel scaling with flag but that was only temporary stopgap measure the truth is our existing approach to measuring horizontal positions on screen is somewhat ill conceived and it needs to be changed the existing approach in our existing approach we attempt to measure the width of characters in given context so for example we can determine that the width of an `a` character in the source coffee meta function coffee` is 11px at the current font size then when we calculate the pixel position for given row and column we just simply total up the recorded width for every character we encounter the problem is that for non fixed width fonts given character doesn have single width kerning ligatures and other stuff the type rendering engine does can result in an `a` taking up different amount of space in different contexts am not an expert in this area yet what worse when subpixel font scaling is turned on chrome starts reporting different widths even for fixed width fonts we re going to need different approach idea for better approach my current thinking is that when calculating pixel position we need to explicitly measure the distance from the beginning of the line to the column in question rather than consulting our encyclopedia of character widths this was our original approach but moved away from it because we were naively reading the dom whenever we needed to translate positions which was causing reflows but we actually can safely read this information so long as we do so either at the start of an update before we actually update the dom or at the end of an update after we are finished updating the dom when simply moving the cursor we can measure before the update when typing however we need to measure after the update in order for the content to be on screen then trigger another update based on our measurement we may also be able to make these measurements off dom like in an iframe or something my main concern here is making sure that we capture all the styling that applied to the text we may be able to draw line at the shadow boundary and just say the only styling that we will apply for purposes of character measurement is the syntax themes theme stylesheets could easily be loaded in an iframe via the `atom styles` element or we could set up the entire world in this iframe and measure there or maybe there some other better approach to character measurement out there that atom should apply instead the main requirements are as follows measurement should not force blocking reflow measurement should capture user styling as seamlessly as possible measurement should handle different widths being reported for the same character in different contexts as is currently the case with subpixel font scaling enabled can anyone from the community help out with this ideas are welcome if they re specific code would be even more helpful as cii know pinging you on ton of stuff lately but this seems right in your wheelhouse based on your recent presenter work cc atom non github maintainers >>>editor-rendering help-wanted

the insanity of unicode rtl override this is bug report mostly based on this neat article http habrahabr ru post 252813 ll summarize the essence that relates to atom right here consider this snippet of python that line properly escaped the symbols of interest in order of appearance are 8238 or rlo right to left override and 8236 or pdf pop directional formatting they respectively reverse text direction and set it back atom expands this combination just like browser would it actually displays that rlo pdf piece in reverse however interaction with it is awkward start with the fact that you can at least visually move your cursor inside that gap in any way look at this with plain text grammar on ve selected that line screenshot http imgur com q6kkb0m png noticed that 10 units of extra space notice also that between rlo and pdf are exactly 10 characters that hint however once switch on python grammar and rlo pdf interval is now contained in multiple elements things get even more awkward screenshot http imgur com qpopcdm png not 10 units as before now we have only and from that moment don have slightest clue about what going on but something needs to be done about that this needs discussion can immediately come up with these two general directions interpret as designed in unicode fix the ui make the cursor work properly and not introduce gaps like the ones above represent unicode control characters with some sort of placeholders and don let them act as designed in unicode personally stand for placeholders as atom is mostly code editor and code is raw sequence of characters it makes sense for atom to display it as closely as possible to how the parser will see it in those cases when plain text is used to author document that makes use of these sequences to display properly preview plugins come into play and let you preview the document as it will look after processing thoughts >>>bug editor-rendering

cannot disable packages in safe mode can load atom in anything but safe mode presumably because of bad package unfortunately can use package cop because it doesn work in safe mode went to the settings page to disable packages there were two problems when scroll down go into settings for package can go back can have to click on packages again and start at the top this is serious problem when you have 100 packages all enabled packages show the `install` button which makes no sense and since there is no `settings` button can disable anything ll use the command line but that is lot of typing the above problems need fixing windows atom 187 >>>enhancement
support html first workflow google polymer takes an html first approach to defining custom elements rather than calling javascript method to register an element you instead use custom tag to declare elements the polymer team had difficulty using this approach in atom for couple of reasons issues running inline scripts due to our content security policy this is the biggest hurdle there currently no way to white list script tags in an imported html document content security policy can be associated with nonce value that can be inserted into scripts to indicate they are runnable and it would be nice if we could cascade this nonce through an html import to script tags in the imported content needing to manually insert html imports into the this is easily solvable via service that presents function like `loadhtmldocument fullpath rather do it with `require` but node style requires are expected to be synchronous and waiting for the imported content to load is async this would therefore still require tiny bit of boilerplate in `activate` to interact with the service and load the package main document >>>api atom enhancement

configurable stylesheets through user variables less we were having this discussion https discuss atom io how to allow users to override my packages less variables 15243 braver and jessegrosjean came up with the idea of `user variables less` file there have been attempts to set less variables through config and they have failed for various reasons while config would be preferable for discovery and ease of use if it doesn work perhaps there is another way users can now overrule styles with their own stylesheet but that very limited it impossible to change the overall hue of let say one dark ui because those colors are everywhere throughout the stylesheet and the selectors would just be insane if you can change the variable however it just single number the idea would be to have user variables less file in addition to the syntax variables and the ui variables theme and package authors can choose where to place the import thereby maintaining control over which variables can be changed by the user what can be changed can be communicated in the package readme this doesn change the user stylesheet behaviour and would be added in addition to that stylesheet so while think we can agree this is not the ideal solution the ideal solution being unavailable this could be brilliant compromise that opens up lot of options >>>enhancement

close tab after split or allow independent editing perhaps this was conscious design choice but feel like it would be better to close tab after you ve split it to the right left whatever so for example if have `myfile coffee` open and choose split right then the original one on the left should be closed or an alternate suggestion would be to just allow dual editing in the same file in the current state of atom if you have the same file opened in two different tabs and they are scrolled to different positions when you make change in say the left one then the right one will automatically scroll to the position of the change it somewhat common use case for me to reference the top of one file while editing the bottom of it for things like say checking method signatures thoughts >>>more-information-needed

upgrade to jasmine partly related to 5354 decided to investigate how difficult could it have been to upgrade jasmine to warning please note that this is an experimental branch and there are bunch of features that do not work yet including some specs which do not pass due to jasmine breaking changes warning what doesn work `terminalreporter` excluded it for the time being and am using jasmine `consolereporter` cause it seems to provide almost all functionalities on the other hand it seems like `apm test` doesn exit even when specs have finished and suppose it may be related to this `timereporter` introduced new way of creating custom reporters and this has to be adapted as well old async specs provided some examples upgrading some specs about how jasmine is supposed to work with asynchronous tests you can find more information here https github com jasmine jasmine issues 526 old custom matchers the syntax has changed for those as well updated `vendor jasmine jquery js` to allow some of the matchers to be compatible with the new specification but there are still bunch of them which aren ported yet old spies expectation many expectation have changed since and now need to be upgraded `andcallthrough` vs `and callthrough` `setincludedtags` this should filter out some specs as far as understand but jasmine doesn seem to provide an alternative needs further investigation `waits this served as way of yielding to the ui thread `waits` method does not exist anymore and therefore we need to find another solution `setspecfield` `currentrunner method has been deprecated thus we need to find another solution wonder if this is still needed therefore it would be great if you could provide some feedback pray suspicious jasmine initialization am not 100 sure the solution below is the best practice to load jasmine but couldn find any other feasible initialization strategy needs investigation but it should be straightforward coffee jasmine require jasmine window jasmine new jasmine jasmine consolereporter require jasmine running test via ui for now have only used `apm test` to run tests but we need to make sure that `atomreporter` works fine as well am sure left out many other things which are not evident to me it my first contribution to atom as you may already know therefore please feel free to leave comment wherever you find something suspicious so that can update incrementally this main post to keep track of what missing discussion as thedaniel mentioned on 5354 one of the main concerns of upgrading is to keep package specs working quoting his statement all community package specs are written to so there would need to be some kind of mechanism to allow package to opt in to and run by default possible solution may be to have two separate suites jasmine bootstrap which loads all the specs that are known to be compatible package owners may tag such specs somehow maybe filename suffix or subdirectory could be sufficient jasmine bootstrap the default one which will load any other spec am still not sure how difficult could it be to make this approach work but hope we can discuss about it smile couldn tackle this all on my own especially because cannot contribute to atom full time and this is my first contribution on the other hand hope this pull request can be good starting point for us to go on and shipit >>>enhancement

api for creating custom gutters motivation the decorations api allows you to attach class to gutters and other things and thus style them however we are working on feature that requires us to be able to add our own html elements to the gutter and would like to propose an api to do that feature we would like to add buttons to the gutter next to lines that contain test definition clicking on the button would run that test this is similar to functionality in xcode why css doesn work adding css only allows us to create buttons via before or after pseudo elements these elements can respond to events targeted to them instead any events they receive will register on the existing line number gutter element the gutter element already has another action to take in response to click it may expand or collapse section of code if we tried to add events to the gutter element itself instead of new child div our events would conflict with the existing events from atom how the line numbers in the gutter work currently when the editor is scrolled line number divs that have scrolled offscreen are removed and new line number divs for newly onscreen lines are added the changes are primarily in the guttercomponent class in appendorupdatevisiblelinenumbernodes which calls into buildlinenumberhtml and removelinenumbernodes proposed change the most flexibility that an atom api could offer is the ability to accept function that will be run on each line number div after it added and before it removed for any teardown work in practice this could lead to changes that affect things that might be considered core to atom look it seems like this opens too much flexibility more pared down api that atom could offer is the ability to add column next to the gutter either on the left side or right side though it understandable to limit this to the left side because the right side is occupied by foldability the api for gutter object would accept function that is given the line number and returns div for that line number which would be inserted into the dom next to the appropriate line number it would make sense for this insertion to be done in atom core code because it already manages the positioning of the line numbers and does this via absolute positioning for performance optimisation desired gutter features adding gutters create gutter you will most likely create one gutter instance per editor instance api to add gutter to an editor indicate whether to position it to the left or right of the line numbers pass index of sorts to indicate how close far from the edge it should be similar to the priority argument to atom workspace add panel removing gutters remove from view toggle destroy gutter properties to set set the width modifying gutter contents insert something inside div next to each line initialize the gutter object with function that operates on line number and returns dom element as line number divs are inserted and removed as the user scrolls this function is run to determine what to place in the custom gutter next to each line number api could also allow changing this function clear all the items in the gutter convenience for performance by default this function could run just once at initialization on the currently displayed line numbers and be run on progressively more line numbers as the user scrolls the results could be cached the gutter api should also expose method that triggers the function to be run on the currently displayed line numbers or on specific line this could be useful if you want to update the gutter without the editor being scrolled >>>enhancement

have metrics disabled by default or completely removed you need to leave the metrics disabled by default and then at least ask users first time they activate the editor whether they would allow it to be enabled for one will not allow spyware to run on my box hence disable or remove such applications but atom doesn provide clue in the application so if someone haven seen the faq they don know this is problem because atom is then collecting data without consent even if it is in the faq and even if the user has downloaded the application besides find the whole concept of tracking users with the excuse of collecting useful data ridiculous in the entire history of open source this has never been needed and users are extremely helpful in sharing information data and reports about bugs how they use the application and other stuff the metrics package in atom should to be removed from the default install and then you can leave the package for anyone who want to install it by himself from the installation menu or as suggested leave it off at first another important point is that atom is not simply collecting statistical data if that where the case there certainly is no need to create sha1 of each installation mac address that is not collecting statistical data that is specific and individual surveillance which is unacceptable >>>feedback

undo grouping is too eager undo grouping seems to group any editor changes no matter what kind of change it was which results in confusing unexpected behaviour create new file paste some text into it immediately begin typing undo atom will group both the pasting and the typing so the undo removes everything ideally it should only remove the typing with the paste being separate undo st2 has this behaviour and its much nicer ll often start typing after pasting some code and want to undo something just typed it infuriating when the whole lot disappears the same problem happens for many editor commands such as `editor auto indent` perform an auto indent then begin typing or run another command undo will revert both my suggestion is that atom should only group sequences of identical commands disparate commands should never be grouped are there cases where grouping disparate commands makes more sense than keeping them separate >>>enhancement

inconsistent environment and behaviour problem various tools don operate correctly depending on the order and the manner with which atom is started also persisted state is not restored consistently cause depending the manner in which atom is started different environment is inherited launchd event inherits launchd mostly blank env which means no shell env vars `atom` in the terminal inherits currently set vars this applied to when the app is started not when new window is opened in which case that window will inherit the current process env which is normal os behaviour venture the creation of the `atom` command this way is on purpose to work around the lack of env when run from launchd but please dear reader continue on to the next step current workaround anti feature manually control atom startup each time you want to use it in specific environment why is it an anti feature if you want two projects open at the same time but with different environments you re busted also long running sessions and wait what env was that started with already session can also mean the idiomatic document app os way atom app is started but no windows are opened also also frustration quickly sets in when you start it up the wrong way and have to quit and restart halfway through your work and notice your linter does not actually run manual config does not cut it because it manual and constantly changing versions means constantly changing path possible solution wrap atom app startup in login shell make `atom app contents macos atom` script that calls whatever the user shell is as login non interactive one before calling the real `atom` binary to inherit global env so that chruby rbenv gopath whatever works make `atom` command send signal to `atom app` instead of starting atom itself via `contents macos atom` basically `atom foo bar` has no reason to be different from `open atom foo bar` precisely it does not inherit the local environment local environment management is bestowed to package implementor meaning detection of git` `gemfile` rubocop yml` gopath` which they have to do anyway else at least starting via launchd is broken if not more not to manual handling by developer consequences `path` al is properly set and tools like linters can leverage the env to use chruby rbenv whatever clicking the icon starting via spotlight opening file from finder using `open atom` and using `atom foo` on the terminal are all consistent whatever the order they are executed in everything is now consistent and we can now rejoice as glittery roses spontaneously bloom out of bose einstein condensates additional note pet peeve `atom` is currently equivalent to `atom while can see how this could be ok on other platforms this is subtly wrong on os as `atom` is expected to be equivalent to `open atom` start the app and don open anything unless it set up to open new document when no document is opened otherwise merely focus the app and if the app is not started start it on another planet don know if this issue applies to other oses as well besides os everything depends on how process management and app doc task gui model is handled there final word all of this really matters daily when you juggle between projects and makes atom feel like an unfinished brittle product making angry coworkers throwing nails at me for having pushed atom on them think fish shell or god forbid csh >>>enhancement mac

problems with selection and cursor position in complex non latin scripts atom has problem in dealing with devanagari in that the cursor position does not always reflect the actual position if there is some devanagari text in the current line same goes for selecting within lines containing devanagari can also see that atom renders devangari as fully formed devangari with half forms conjuncts ligatures and so on for an editor would much prefer the sublime text approach where devanagari text is treated as string of characters with no attempt to render half forms conjuncts and do the other advanced opentype compositing features instead the text is rendered the way it is typed which is much much easier to edit here is some sample text that borks atom try here to select the and delete them try here to select the devanagari characters and delete them also try to paste those strings into sublime text and see how st renders the devanagari as full forms halants virama matras in sequential order which would prefer because the monospaced fonts we use often do not have devanagari the devanagari is rendered in proportional fall back font if you did as in sublime text you could force the advance width of all the devanagari glyphs to be the same as the default monospaced font that way you could preserve monospaced text and get around the whole very thorny issue of mixing in complex non latin scripts in monospaced environment just an idea so up to you to find out if that would actually be way to go note that you have partially fixed the issue in 140 but its still not perfect take this example line if you try to select it with the mouse from the end towards the beginning of the line then the last br is not selected if you select the devanagari text and press delete then you end up with this notice the missing in the closing span tag atom version 140 os version mac os 10 10 misc versions apm 0 108 0 npm 1 4 node 0 10 32 python 2 6 git 1 3 >>>bug editor-rendering

pluralize project api status pull request ready to review merge via nathansobo here an initial take we want to make it easier to work with files from various locations on disk from within the same atom window and the features we have in mind will impact the project api conceptually the two primary changes we want to make are the following projects can contain multiple folders the fuzzy finder should search across all project folders the tree view should display all project folders workspaces can contain multiple projects at any one time there is an active project the fuzzy finder searches across only one active project at time the tree view can show multiple projects with the active project emphasized in some way the api implications for this seem to be as follows multi folder projects `project getpath` getrepo` etc need to be replaced by getpaths` getrepositories` getdirectories` etc the `directory` class should probably be expanded to include some of the methods on `project` `project scan` and replace` can continue to work across all directories multi project workspaces replace `atom project` with `workspace getactiveproject` add `workspace getprojects` at first we may just want to add the pluralized apis for reading but not add methods to enable multiple directories projects to actually be added >>>shipping

config api changes status donezo via nathansobo abstract this roadmap proposes replacing scoped properties with scoped config settings in short you ll be allowed to specify css selector when calling `config set` and `config get` will optionally accept token against which to evaluate its selectors this roadmap also proposes adding `config ondidchange` method to replace the `callnow` property to observe` tasks config schema https github com atom atom pull 3613 add types and things to the config use schema for specifying config deprecate all the `getint` style methods eliminate `callnow false` add `config ondidchange` api move syntax properties into config https github com atom atom pull 3697 currently `syntax` supports scoped config settings it doesnt make sense to have multiple config systems this unifies them and will put us in good place to do scoped configs eg enable softwrap for markdown hard tabs for bash etc see https github com atom atom issues 2593 https github com atom language make issues add optional selectors to `config get set` forward deprecated writes to `atom syntax` to `atom config` forward deprecated reads on `atom syntax` to `atom config` read from `atom config` instead of `atom syntax` register scoped properties with `atom config` instead of `atom syntax` when loading packages allow scoped settings to be observed api writing scoped settings we can add an optional selector as the first argument to `config set` and `config setdefaults` for example this enabled soft wrapping on anything in the gfm` scope but disables it for code blocks within markdown we would need to update the editor to be capable of honoring these settings within given scope reading scoped settings we can update `config get` and `config observe` to take an optional token that must match against selectors here an example of determining if we should use soft tabs in particular context observing scoped settings we can also extend the api to allow scoped settings to be observed this should assume that the token is immutable meaning that if the token scope changes we ll need to set up new observation eliminating callnow false one final change unrelated to the scoped properties is to add simple ondidchange` method to `config` that replaces the `callnow false` option to observe` this brings the config api into line with changes we ve made elsewhere where observefoo` calls the callback immediately and ondidchangefoo` calls it only on the next change >>>shipping

reuse modules across installed packages currently packages are all installed to atom packages` but since there is no `package json` file or `node modules` folder in atom packages` none of the packages ever share common module when the dependency versions match so if you have 10 packages that depend on 1` of underscore plus 10 copies of the same underscore plus version will be required this dramatically affects startup time since each version can take up to 10 15ms to require one solution is to add seeded cache of common package modules in atom packages node modules` that would be populated and maintained by `apm` such that `apm install` would also dedupe modules across packages then we can just document the common modules and tell people to add something like this to their `package json` file and possibly include in `apm init` if they want to use them this offers nice middle ground where we don have to export these common modules and worry about bumping the atom major version when one changes its major version we can just recommend what versions packages authors bind to and control and maintain well tuned cache of them so that depending on them doesn slow down your package >>>shipping

clean up context menu api consistent api initially set out to return `disposable` instances from `atom contextmenu add` but then noticed that the format for expressing items didn match up with `atom menu add` this pr corrects that you can now add context menus with the same format as adding application menus with selectors mapping to arrays containing menu items as follows created and should display hooks there also new `shoulddisplay` hook to address use case saw in color picker which is currently digging into `contextmenumanager` internals to conditionally display menu item this is sketch of how the api could be used but not real code from the actual color picker the `executeatbuild` hook has been replaced with `created` couldn find anyone using this other than us because it wasn exposed in our api so went ahead and just renamed it without shimming here the `created` hook being used to add the `x` and `y` of the click event to the command dev mode dev mode only items were formerly expressed with trailing options hash on the entire call to add` now each individual item can contain `devmode` field indicating whether it should only display in dev mode you can see this in the `inspect element` example above disposables finally add` now returns disposable on which dispose` can be called to remove the added item descriptors outreach we should probably talk to the author of color picker and any other packages that dig into context menu internals to get them to switch to the new api we may even want to send them pr before merging this if the number is manageable cc atom core >>>shipping

invisible devtools mode when have the devtools closed sometimes they pop up to tell me about an error that occurred but there never stack trace so this error message isn very actionable it my understanding that stacktraces are only captured when the devtools are open before the error is thrown one solution to this is to always have the devtools open but that takes up screen space another is to pop them out of the atom window but that gets confusing if you have multiple windows open it would be nice to have some kind of invisible devtools mode where it will still capture stacktraces and do whatever else it does but otherwise have the editor work normally there probably some kind of performance penalty incurred by having the devtools open so maybe this could be behind flag like `atom debug` >>>enhancement

atom does not respect modern permissions umask acl when creating files atom relies solely on `umask` which is standard on linux however `acl` is the new standard for permissions and every modern api works with acl for the most part but atom seems to not notice or care about acl which results in improper permissions say for example this is very basic canonical and not actually how acl works by command or this results in dev being unopenable by anybody but me but because of acl but allows any file created within that folder to be readable by anybody so that there are no permissions problems when uploading files to servers repos or other places atom does not respect this and it always results in files being created with the `umask` and not `getfacl` mask >>>linux

atom erasing the content of files when there is not enough disk space have hard time replicating this issue since it will require me filling up the disk again but in nutshell the problem is that when edit file in atom if the disk space is not enough to save it find that the file content is erased this happened to me more than once yeah need more gbs of disk space so can certify that it is atom the one causing the issue the issue appears whenever edit the file not when just open it the problem is not that atom is not being able to save the file that would make sense if there is no disk space available the problem is that atom removes all the content and of course afterwards not able to recover it have no clue of why may this be happening>>>atom bug post-1.0-roadmap quality-bogle

move line down up bugs move line down and up seem to be pretty buggy and slow will try to summarize the different issues ve come across some are enhancements depending on your perspective move line down with cursor in column then press undo the cursor will start going down below the buffer and exceptions will start being thrown from tokenized buffer select entire penultimate line won allow you to move it down whether or not there is trailing newline at eof moving folds will cause it to unfold and generally cause lots of problems the fold markers can be corrupted if you try to undo moving lines past fold can cause it to unfold and have issues slow with large number of lines issue 3128 only supports cursor issue 2470 attempted to rewrite the movelinedown function and solved most of these issues except for the undo problems which became much worse due to my approach generally undo gets very confused if you have selection setbufferrange or editor createfold in conjunction with insert delete the only reason can see that rebuilding the selection or the folds is necessary is because there is no way to insert text just before the cursor without it becoming part of the selection or fold if someone can point me towards way to insert just before selection or fold without the text becoming part of that selection or fold then can simplify the code and not run into any undo problems alternatively perhaps it is bug that undo can cause problems but that may be more difficult for me to know how to fix properly can provide more details or test code if desired tossed my initial prototype up here https gist github com anonymous aaaa9ec5bb642dab8d26 atom 121 >>>bug

intermediate api docs format we will be using biscotto to generate the metadata https gist github com benogle dc81fc7bb841e5926258 this format is super raw the doc strings are not parsed the links to other classes are not resolved and there is lot in there that will not end up in the docs think we should build something to translate the biscotto format into json document that closely mirrors the structure of the html docs the doc strings will be parsed external libs will be pulled in eg text buffer and the links to other classes will be resolved to some degree it should be such that the thing consuming the format can be really dumb html generator requiring very little state this should give us options when creating an html generator atom io can have generator that first indexes the document then integrates the docs into the site we might create static generator for projects like atom highlights atom text buffer or the docs locally in atom proposed format status all `status` fields will be `essential` or `extended` markdown all fields worthy of display will be in markdown format links links will be in markdown format as relative links within the doc if the html generator sees link in this format it should resolve it to whatever structure it is using to generate pages inline source we talked about inlining the method source code in the docs we could just include the code with in each of the method objects but feel like we should keep it simple and just link to the source for now inlining the source can be feature we add later feedback tell me what you guys think especially thedaniel as he will be consuming and indexing it >>>api

embed git and detect system git without path as of now installing atom on windows involves cloning the repo and building it from source this assumes you already have git because the build system uses git to download other parts of the program as atom gets an official windows build however git may or may not be installed on users machines user may also choose between github git for desktop or msysgit there should be operating modes for atom based on these cases integrate with github git for desktop detect the user msysgit installation without using the path environment variable first check the default installation location and if it not there prompt the user to supply path where it installed call the binaries directly from that path operate with an embedded version of git this can be accomplished in the same way atlassian sourcetree works download portable release of msysgit and use the binaries from that operate without git integration and not complain the user should have the option to choose any of the modes in the the settings dialog and by default atom should attempt to use them in that order this suggestion is mostly based on the windows version of atom but could apply equally across all platforms with minor modifications remove the github desktop option substitute msysgit for git etc >>>enhancement

integrating atom and github for windows so am in awe of the aesthetics of the github client for windows it minimalist neat clean functional just very pleasing all around and it successfully abstracts from the nitty bitty pieces of command line git atom seems to want to be the same thing for code editing only allowing for all that extra customizability via packages and css styling etc now that have been trying both for the last few days it seems to me logical next step to open and edit files directly from the github client can imagine both atom being just another module or page inside the github client or the github client gets removed and all its functionality integrated into the atom tree view via context menu entries or second tree view pane with repositories etc has any thought been given to this kind of thing love to see that and given atom extensibility sure package is just around the corner >>>enhancement windows

support configurable non uniform visually aligned tab stops would like to raise the issue of configurable tab stops proposal has been floating around the web for few years called elastic tabstops http nickgravgaard com elastictabstops that promises to usher in the next generation of source code alignment it aims to make it easy to align code blocks and side comments both for traditional coders using monospaced fonts and for those of us who prefer proportional fonts it would also make it easy to edit tabular data be it tsv tab separated values or table in markdown or other markup languages would gladly write an extension myself to realize elastic tabstops but unfortunately it one of those things that require very specific feature in the editor component the ability to specify non uniform tab stops as list of visual positions eg pixel or em not characters that may be different for each line right now the tab support in atom is just trick span with certain number of blank characters it not even true tab stop as is painfully evident when using proportional font screen shot 2014 06 06 at 15 38 14 https cloud githubusercontent com assets 48756 3200906 0830fd42 ed82 11e3 9b00 b39a15ac2fd9 png seeing as work is currently underway to write the newer react based editor component just wanted to throw this feature request out there to the clever people writing such code fully aware that it is not simple task because it transcends the character counting nature of the current code doing it without triggering reflow for each tab stop to query the current width of the line being composed is even harder it would require pre caching the em width of every character for the current font or something along those lines but it one of those features that would set atom apart from any other editor again the tricky part is just the configurable tab stops that would allow extension writers to align code tables and other data with various algorithms including elastic tabstops >>>enhancement

log error when command fails the problem when brand new like me the problem could be anywhere so clumsily looking at everything to try and figure out where the issue is all can see is that nothing happens the specific issue was that had the command correctly loaded into the `activationevents` in the json file and my lib my project coffee worked correctly but didn have the `main` set up to load the file because generated it with apm init convert` to load my textmate plugin rather than with `generate package` assume what happens is that when run the command it goes to find the command which should be there because it is added in the `activate` key but it is not there since the file did not get loaded because it is not there it silently fails and removes the commands from the list of commands the desired behaviour ideally the system would log enough information for me to figure out where the issue is keep in mind that very very new so have very little ability to troubleshoot based on reasoning about the system like to know it not in my keymap file it not in my package json something like this would be helpful my package my command was registered as an activationevent but could not be found as command maybe also link to common reasons this could happen such as the command was never the name is wrong describing way to see the list of registered commands in the given namespace would help lot here the file was never required the file wasn specified in the main command of package json another possibility don know if it reasonable to have coffee files in lib without having main in package json but maybe linting of package json would catch this or maybe there combination of things files in lib no main commands in activationlist if this is something that could be caught it would also be nice if it would run automatically on saving of package json>>>enhancement

selections do not always disappear immediately causing overwrites occasionally when selecting text and typing over it the selection remains and selects the next text of the same length or sometimes one character because of this typing over selection causes the original text and the new selection to be overwritten in the case that the selection is replaced by the one character selection typing continually replaces the same character until delay in typing occurs the expected behavior is that the selection and selected text both disappear immediately when beginning to type using atom 99 on os 10 3>>>atom bug editor-rendering

chmod build for deb or build in place instead of tmp the assumption of your build scripts is that all people use the default insecure permissions provided by ubuntu but this is not true quite few of us default all user `umask` to `0077` and use `getfacl` and `setfacl` to adjust per directory permissions inside of the home directory this results in dpkg going nuts unless you adjust the `umask` ahead of time which is fair enough for programmers and systems experts but if you plan to build one stop shop for building atom please consider taking into consideration consistency enforcement to prevent silly `dpkg deb` errors there are several options here in my opinion set the `umask` before you even get started build in place and use `setfacl` on custom tmp folder inside of the build directory `chmod` everything if you guys provide me with your preference be more than happy to send pull addressing this issue and providing quite bit of system consistency enforcement for your debian build scripts >>>build-error linux

package manager should allow dependencies to be placed on other plugins currently packages that are pluggable such as autocomplete plus and atomlinter are dependent on their own implementations of plugin style functionality in order to better support packages like this think that we should be able to support packages having dependencies what would like to see is capabilities added for the following subscribe to package manager to get instance of package when it is loaded when loaded subscribed package should expose instance of package created so sub modules can execute against loaded package for instance if the workspace was separate module we would get the workspace by subscribing to the workspace load rather than it being available globally on the atom object ability to subscribe to loaded packages by metadata filter something like what atom linter does to find linters that have been loaded but subscribed like we subscribe to all current and future editors simple interface for verifying version via semver of the subscribed package are of the correct version and when not alerting the user that the modules need updating this would give us the ability to dynamically and bi directionally link modules to each other >>>enhancement

packaging atom for debian let discuss getting atom into debian here before we start trying to file ton of issues elsewhere it sounds like even though the vast majority of these repos have license file debian requires license information in every source file right joergff let talk about alternatives or how we can work around this because atom is composed of literally hundreds of modules and asking them to all adhere to this requirement is intractably difficult for almost no practical benefit one possibility that comes to my head if it truly isn possible to negotiate this requirement is to write tool to mirror all of the atom repos to another github org but to run post processing tool on the sources to add the copyright header thoughts cc kevinsawicki probablycorey thedaniel who were closing some of these issues earlier >>>linux

gutter selection issues ported from http discuss atom io gutter selection bug 8719 issue occurred on 93 as yet untested on 94 though the release notes for 94 don say anything about selection issues being fixed have found few issues with selections over the course of the beta few have been solved but one remains and it has an ugly cousin the simple point is that when making selection if the cursor which still held down in drag crosses over the gutter between the line numbers and the editor area itself atom seems to take this as the cursor is at the end of the line if you move the mouse beyond this gutter into the actual line numbers we re back to normal the ugly cousin is that if the line being selected is longer than the editor window and there no wrapping thus selecting the end of the line would cause the editor to scroll there nice back and forth game it likes to play am currently unable to upload gif but see my original post http discuss atom io gutter selection bug 8719 for now if you want to see both of these in action update gif crazy selection https cloud githubusercontent com assets 412784 2913979 3e3eed40 d694 11e3 97d8 e28f78dec64c gif >>>bug editor-rendering

atom opens new window for file that is outside of current working directory suppose that open atom in my home directory the working directory shown on the left is my home directory now if want to open file that is not in the working directory then atom opens new window with that file and its directory same thing happens if want to open third file that is outside of those two working directories is this the intended behavior because it bugging me that cannot open file outside of the current working directory in the same window also dragging the tab from one window to the other only creates an untitled tab in the destination window and the source tab remains in the source window guess this is another issue but it probably has something to do with atom only allowing opening file that is in the window current working directory >>>enhancement

frequently excessive cpu memory consumption over the last few weeks ive noticed that atom is frequently consuming what would consider fairly large amount of resources it seems that just having single window open without even openning any tabs buffers will predictably open couple of usually two sometimes three atom helper processes which will between them consume 100 of one cpu core worth of activity sometimes this is heavily weighted towards single atom helper process 100 on one single digit percentage on the othersas the above screenshot shows but other times its split fairly evenly across number of atom helper processes 30 40 on each of three processes as you can see from the screenshot this is occuring with the github github repo with no files open dont think its due to any search indexing scanning processes or anything that imagine happen when you first open directory since the activity continues predictably even if leaving the window open for like 20 minutes the memory consumption is also frequently the top item in my list again this is without having any buffers open atom memory https cloud githubusercontent com assets 296432 2603699 427dcd22 bb32 11e3 8373 1f290c4bd0ab png fwiw ive tried leaving atom open with no open buffers in much smaller folders repos than github github too and there doesnt appear to be any discernible difference in cpu or memory consumption im not really sure if this issue helps at all since it doesnt really suggest concrete bug or problem that has clearly actionable fix im sorry about that but felt like this was worth bringing up gift heart >>>performance

collaboration first run experience so currently collaboration needs bit of explanation as to how it works for first time users the basic premise is that host will start session by clicking on the collaboration icon in the bottom right of their status bar of an open editor this will then create link in their system clipboard which they can copy to another user via chat or other means the other user which will now be referred to as the guest clicks on the link and opens new window as long as the following are true they will wind up with wind where they can type and they can see the other user cursor the guest and host must be logged into github the host project must be in git if the project already exists on the guest computer at github it must have been cloned from the same origin your trees must not have diverged ie you can do clever things with rewriting history on the host but not the guest if project doesn exist on the guest computer at that location it copied from the host and saved there also if something fails we need to explain how user can correct it so they don feel lost >>>enhancement

keymap improvements so nathansobo and were talking about how to handle complex keybindings for first class vim support during summit ve run into several issues while thinking about it the first is issue are vim `dd` and `d motion like `diw` commands which ideally would have separate lines in the keymap file so users could remap them as they wish something along the lines of this unfortunately the keymap currently fires the first binding that matches therefore if user types it will trigger `vim mode delete` twice instead of triggering `vim mode delete line` once another issue ve found that wish we had way to do some basic globbing this syntax would allow me to restrict the possible keys entered without exhaustively listing them if it easier maybe we could just accept regexps here rather than trying to create subset note this is also required for `f` and `t` motions like to hear what others think about these proposals >>>enhancement

moving cursor with status bar enabled repaints the whole screen some time ago kevinsawicki and discovered that the entire screen was repainting whenever the cursor moved we tracked the issue down to updating the cursor position text in the status bar which was combining with the legacy flexbox implementation to cause the entire screen to relayout and repaint when we upgraded to the new flexbox spec implementation the issue went away we concluded that the newer flexbox code must have been smart enough to know that the rest of the elements hadn changed and didn need to be repainted at some point since then the situation has regressed with the show repaint rects option enabled in the dev tools here what it looks like to move the cursor without the status bar enabled screen shot 2013 05 10 at 15 17 pm https cloud github com assets 1789 490314 f8df3c0a b9b6 11e2 8f85 c3b4386fe826 png note the multiple colored outlines around various lines these indicate that the lines are being repainted two at time due to the line highlight class being added and removed this is the repaint you would expect and is extremely low overhead now with the status bar enabled screen shot 2013 05 10 at 14 58 pm https cloud github com assets 1789 490324 26f744fc b9b7 11e2 8cf5 f3cbf55dc633 png note that now there is only colored outline around the entire window indicating that everything has been redrawn this takes way longer and hurts performance lot checked out the commit in which kevin and made the change just to make sure not crazy had some other issues getting anything but an untitled buffer to load but the repainting works properly with the status bar enabled screen shot 2013 05 10 at 36 19 pm https cloud github com assets 1789 490390 d1fffa40 b9b9 11e2 8dbc 3c0e8d3f2ecf png not exactly sure when this went bad it expensive to bisect because of the various versions of cef and cefode would need to download my theory is that something changed in webkit to make it slow again perhaps this will change again when we switch to newer version of chromium with atom shell if not zcbenz do you think this is something you could investigate in the chromium source code it would be great to understand if there an approach we can take to limit repaint or if there an optimization that could be added to webkit to avoid the issue if anyone on our team can figure it out it you >>>bug

idea allow `require` to supply scripts with fake global variables because we re mixing node style synchronous require model with lot of javascript that was designed to run into the browser we often need to modify scripts that expect certain global variables to be present for example jquery ui expects jquery to be available in its global namespace and fails when we require it currently it would be nice if we could somehow supply hash of globals that we close over when evaluating scripts that we require like this any free variable references to jquery would then be resolved to the passed in object one issue with this is the following what happens when you call require again with different values for the same variables should we return the cached value say we make the caching conditional on the value of the variables or just throw an exception if it called second time with different values this would also require some modification to node not totally sure it good idea but it might be nice general solution to what will likely be very common problem in the early years of atom if we become popular enough people will start writing their js libraries to run in both modes but until then it would be nice to have something to help us paper over the awkwardness zcbenz thoughts on implementing this >>>enhancement
