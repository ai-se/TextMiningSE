missing information in config database setup rst the documentation on config database setup rst is confusing and seems to be missing information it appears to be cut and pasted from config local settings rst but makes no sense out of context for example the following configures the django database settings but there is no command or configuration instruction after that also there is reminder to run `django admin py` which isn installed when using pip on ubuntu at least it wasn for me using fresh install of graphite on ubuntu 14 04 with the following as root >>>documentation

clarifications on cluster documentation and no data errors so am dealing with clustering graphite for week now it mostly works but would like to check some stuff that between blog posts documentation issues in gh is little confusing this is my setup at the moment using graphite `pip` installed from master tarball as of last week current situation https imgur com cbtjhtg png the frontend server has server and on `destinations` and using consistent hashing there also nginx that only load balances requests to port 80 to the graphite web interfaces on server and server servers and are configured the same way carbon relay also using consistent hashing to carbon caches running on different ports and `127 1` the web apps on servers and are configured with `data dirs` pointing to the whisper and rrd paths rrds are not used the path is just there they also have `cluster servers` set to include server and and `carbonlink hosts` set to the localhost carbon caches matching the order on the relay `destinations` each server also has `memcache hosts` configured with only localhost memcached server now the main problem have is no data errors on both graphite web dashboards graphs grafana graphs and on nagios tests using `check graphite` usually they only stand for few seconds where no data is sent on json output that means and they the data appears again with no interruption or anything the data is there it just not served those are the things have tried based on blog posts documentation and github issues first setup used graphite web with `cluster servers` configured to point to all web apps server server and frontend got lot more missing data and weird errors also `data dirs` and `carbonlink hosts` made no sense in this context for the frontend web app but graphite would not start without them configured read somewhere that you have to get carbon cache instance on the frontend that receives no data and add it to `carbonlink hosts` but that sounded little crazy tried many `cluster servers` options but between blog posts issues and documentation could not ever figure out if you are supposed to have all servers on this list or all servers except for local host or not to include the frontend web app gave up on the frontend web app started using nginx as load balancer between server and server webapps this worked little better `cluster servers` confusion still though tried to have only the other server on each `cluster servers` atm have both servers there `memcache hosts` is another point of confusion in 1102 obfuscurity mentions not using memcached on backend hosts what tried and generated horrible load on the servers using the same list of memcache hosts on both servers also didn help with the no data issue atm am running each web app with `127 1` memcached so my question is really about clarifications and how to actually configure the cluster on the right way specially if should continue doing the nginx load balancing or to go back to frontend web app and in this case what are the correct values for `cluster servers` `data dirs` and `carbonlink hosts` if someone has working cluster and want to share some config files would be grateful >>>documentation

logarithmic scale with minimum axis value renders incorrectly imported from https bugs launchpad net bugs 1092568 reported by campbell stephenson https launchpad net campbell stephenson date created dec 20 2012 hi am having problem with version 10 of graphite when applying logarithmic scale base 10 on the axis and specifying minimum value of to the axis the series data has value of about 42k and it renders correctly without the scale or the minimum value if apply minimum value of zero to the axis it renders correctly but if specify minimum value of graphite chooses maximum value of 40k so the series it not visible not too bothered about this but thought it was worth mentioning if apply logarithmic scale base 10 on the axis without minimum set the series renders correctly but if specify minimum value of the series is rendered below the 10k line which is incorrect any help would be greatly appreciated campbell>>>launchpad_import

feature new aggregation and compression method imported from https bugs launchpad net bugs 899812 reported by fmikus https launchpad net fmikus date created dec 04 2011 once the ceres database is available one key element that differentiates the most cutting edge professional storage mechanisms is the aggregation and compression method ceres has the possibility to implement more efficient algorithms for storing time series data the use of fan interpolators or straight line interpolative methods to store only the relevant data points in time series this can achieve compression ratios of 20 35x versus raw data while also staying accurate to within defined maximum deviation this is particularly interesting for industrial process data or trends that typical aggregation methods like min max average render too coarse average aggregation have high compression ratio but for more accuracy administrators also typically add min and max aggregation which is still by no means an accurate representation of the time series thus ending up with data points time value in rrdtool or data points time values in whisper for approx 20x compression ratio with high accuracy loss whereas little upfront processing can make data point time value much more accurate and still achieve 20 35x compression versus the raw data all data points between two stored values can be interpolated to be straight line between the two data points this eliminates both time and data values to interpolation google for data compression for process historians by peter james for comparison of various algorithms this would be great implementation mini project for anyone with little statistical background and bit of python knowledge >>>launchpad_import
